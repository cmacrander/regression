<h2>Game System</h2>
<p>

  We'll use the <a href="https://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core-downloads/">Fate Core System</a>, with some small exceptions. I want room for the characters to grow quickly at the beginning, so we're going to simplify the "phase trio" part of character setup and include just High Concept, Trouble, and "first adventure" aspects. Also we'll limit ourselves to one stunt at first. I think it will be more fun to discover more aspects and stunts during play. So please familiarize yourself with the rules, and consider a character background story and what aspects, stunts, and skills you might want.

</p>
<h3>Modified Skills</h3>
<p>

  The <em>Crafts</em> skill is divided in this game world into <em>Hardware</em> and <em>Software</em>. <em>Hardware</em> is just like <em>Crafts</em> in the vanilla system. <em>Software</em> is the skill of working with computer systems. For Overcome or Create and Advantage actions, it allows you to break or fix a computer's behavior, or devise a novel program. The Attack and Defend actions are only applicable if your character has had preparation time and managed to gain control of some fly-by-wire mechanism.
