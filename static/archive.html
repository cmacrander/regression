            <h2>Backstory</h2>
<p>In the five years since 2017, two nations have been occupied and one has drowned beneath the rising seas, the South China Sea belongs to the PRC, AI has soaked deeper into the fabric of the first world, little has changed for the poor, and humans have returned to the moon.</p>
<p>The Trump administration never got off the ground geopolitically. After it became clear the Commander in Chief could neither strategize effectively nor accept advice from those who could, Russia and China made decisive moves, anticipating a weak response from the World&rsquo;s Policeman. Russia has annexed Georgia and Estonia, and China has declared that it would start enforcing it&rsquo;s &ldquo;border&rdquo; in the South China Sea and moved in the oil rigs. In both cases US forces pulled back without incident.</p>
<p>The island nation of Tuvalu, without the wealth or credit to reinforce its infrastructure and facing imminent sea level rise that would displace half its population, has instructed all of its citizens to evacuate, becoming a stateless nation.</p>
<p>Gary Herbert, former governor of Utah, got ahold of the infamous Russian Hotel Tapes and intimidated the incumbent into not running in 2020. He was elected over his Democratic challenger on a values-and-fiscal-responsibility platform. The GOP&rsquo;s embrace of the nationalist right has become less overt but is still earning them votes.</p>
<p>Research into and commercialization of machine learning algorithms has advanced rapidly and digital services in general are significantly better as a result. AI embedded in networks and operating systems make devices and connections more responsive by learning and predicting user&rsquo;s actions. Many service jobs, like retail, have been replaced by the personable offspring of Siri and Alexa. Many sectors of the economy are notably more efficient because their logistics are being optimized by AI. Self-driving cars are common on the roads and consensus is spreading that they save lives on average.</p>
<p>The trend toward income inequality has continued, but the trickle of improvements in everyday conveniences has prevented any serious unrest from gathering.</p>
<p>Countries outside the G20 have shown no remarkable changes in prosperity, although humanitarian efforts to increase quality of life for the very poor have continued. The WHO has begun to project a peak in the sub-Saharan AIDS crisis; several gambits to reduce malaria-carrying mosquito populations have gone well. But most of the world&rsquo;s people still live chaotic, improverished lives.</p>
<p>SpaceX backed off its timeline to land its crewed spacecraft on Mars several times, but has landed on the moon with a crew of four astronauts. The highly educated and loyal fans of space flight celebrated but the US populace in general are underwhelmed. Conspiracy theorists allow the SpaceX landing was real but maintain the Apollo landings were still fake. Despite this, commerical rocketry has demonstrated there&rsquo;s money to be made and several other companies are refining low cost-to-orbit rockets.</p>
<p>The moon landing highlighted, by its lack of dramatic impact on the public&rsquo;s imagination, a growing ennui in the US. Progressives are increasingly intimidated by the resilience of reactionary ideas, average people are beginning to feel the glow fading from American Exceptionalism in the wake of Russia&rsquo;s and China&rsquo;s advances, daily life is rich with entertainment but thin with real or gainful work.</p>

            

            <div id="the_plane" class="bookmark"></div>

            <h2>The Plane</h2>
<p>On a plane, bound to San Antonio, on the tarmac of Raleigh-Durham International Airport, at 8:26 pm on the 6th of May, 2022. There have been delays getting the passengers on board and a long wait here in the plane and they still haven&rsquo;t pulled away from the terminal. Even though it&rsquo;s late, it&rsquo;s still hot, and the cabin&rsquo;s air conditioning can&rsquo;t quite keep up. Voices can be heard over the intercom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;-n&rsquo;t matter to me, go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, okay. Wait, why isn&rsquo;t this&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have to, hang on&hellip; why is this damn thing so confusing. Oh—&rdquo;, the voice switches to a whisper, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, yeah, it&rsquo;s already on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passengers look up from what they&rsquo;re doing, some looking at each other quizzically. Someone on the other end of the intercom clears their throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We apologize for the delays, folks, and we&rsquo;ll be getting you off to San Antonio as quickly as possible. We&rsquo;re just waiting on some paperwork for the plane&rsquo;s maintenance and then we&rsquo;ll be off. Should be just another few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half an hour later the plane pulls away from the gate. It taxis to the runway and aligns itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attendants prepare for crosscheck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many passengers relax their shoulders and sigh. The plane&rsquo;s engines spin up and the wings start to catch the air. But things feel wrong immediately and everyone either gasps or screams as the plane leaps upward. There&rsquo;s a sickening sideways tilt to the whole cabin and a sudden drop and everyone screams again. Phones and books crash into the ceiling and fly everywhere. The plane&rsquo;s nose sharply twists down again as the rear crashes into the runway. There&rsquo;s a rush of heat and a shimmer from the right side where a wing is dragging along the ground. With a deafening noise the plane skids to a halt half off the side of the runway.</p>

<div class="situation"><p><em>Choking Black Smoke</em>, <em>Crowded with Panicked People</em></p></div>

<p><img alt="seating diagram" src="/images/737_MAX_7.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p>Marcus is one of the first on the plane to collect his wits. He quickly jumps out of his seat and rushes to the aid of the stewardess—who had been sitting by the left rear exit—attempting to open the rear escape hatch. She is having a <em>very</em> hard time opening the hatch. She&rsquo;s trying to pull the red bar in towards her body (it is clearly labeled that it turns down). She knows she&rsquo;s supposed to be able to do this and is on the verge of losing mental control entirely.</p>
<div class="character"><p><strong>Stewardess</strong></p>
<p>Black, smoothed-back hair, shorter than average.</p>
<p><em>Extremely Confused</em></p></div>

<p>Without hesitating, Marcus powers past her and muscles open the door.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overcome: 3 Physique + 3 = 6 (Fantastic) <em>Succeeds with Style</em> +1 boost</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The stewardess is unceremoniously knocked back into the galley and Marcus detaches and tosses out the door as if it were weightless. The emergency slide explosively deploys. Marcus steps back to the main aisle and roars loudly, &ldquo;Everyone off the plane! Exit on the left, not on the right! If you are injured and unable to move, you will be helped!&rdquo; He takes his time observing the scene as he stays out of the way of the aisle</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create an Advantage: 0 Notice + 3 = 3 (Good) <em>Succeeds</em> +1 free invocation on new aspect <em>The Nearest Exit May Be Behind You</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and sees that the exit doors over the left wing are not open yet. He realizes his exit is crucial, but that it&rsquo;s behind everyone and likely to go unnoticed. He tries to be a calming but directing influence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overcome: 1 Rapport - 1  + 2 boost + 2 <em>The Nearest Exit May Be Behind You</em> = 4 (Great) <em>Succeeds</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a loud but clear and authoritative voice, Marcus urges everyone within range to come toward him and go down the slide. The rear of the plane clears much more quickly that it otherwise would have, given the widespread panic. He decides the next most useful thing he could do is help the stewardess recover from her shock so she can assist people going down the slide.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overcome: 1 Rapport - 3 = -2 (Terrible) <em>Fails</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just coming out of a daze caused by minor head injuries, she interprets Marcus&rsquo; attempts to help her off the floor as a second attack on her person and throws her arms in front of her face and screams repeatedly.</p>
<p>Slightly embarassed but in no mood to stop to consider it, Marcus takes advantage of her confusion, picks her up bodily, and tosses her out the door and down the slide</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Attack: 1 Fight + 1 + 2 <em>Extremely Confused</em>  = 4 (Great) <em>Succeeds with Style</em> +1 boost, -1 fate point</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The stewardess vertiably sails out the hatch and lands square in the middle of the slide.</p>
<p>Marcus looks back into the cabin and at first glance&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overcome: 0 Notice + 1 = 1 (Average) <em>Fails</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&hellip;fails to see anyone left. Recognizing he can only see a small part of the plane he attempts to climb forward to clear the rest</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overcome: Athletics 2 - 1 = 1 (Average) <em>Fails</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and stumbles over carry-ons and has trouble seeing in the smoke. He works his way slowly back to the emergency slide, squinting through the smoke and listening as hard as he can, but is interrupted by a flare of red light from further up the plane. His experiences with fire tell him he will be in serious trouble very soon and that he would need a SCBA to help anyone that might remain anyway.</p>
<p>Feeling hopeful that he&rsquo;s done all he can in the plane, he quickly exits. Upon getting to the bottom he moves away from the plane, looking to see if anyone is in distress that might need help</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create an Advantage: 0 Notice + 2 = 2 (Fair) <em>Succeeds with Style</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and he immediately notices the same thing that Sam just has: a crash tender is on scene but isn&rsquo;t jetting water or doing anything else useful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Situation Aspect: <em>You&rsquo;re Doing it Wrong</em> with 2 free invocations</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Tabby never imagined that being seated in an emergency exit row would ever bear relevance, but now the universe has seen fit to provide her with an opportunity. She gathers her wits as best she can; during the chaos she bumped heads with the man in the white shirt and tie next to her. She feels a small trickle of warm blood at her temple, but her row-mate did not fair as well: he seems to be unconscious. Tabby sees that the duty of opening the emergency hatch has now fallen to her, and she&rsquo;s almost excited about it. But without even looking, the heat on the right side of her face communicates the intensity of the fire burning on the wing just outside. No one is getting out that way. Her head swivels to the left and she squints through the smoke.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overcome: 1 Notice + 0 = 1 (Fair) <em>Fails</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are people and smoke around the port wing emergency exits, but Tabby knows she&rsquo;ll have to get closer to see any better. Tabby hesitates only a second looking down at the unconscious man beside her. She quickly removes the bandana holding back her hair and ties it around her mouth to block out the smoke. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back,&rdquo; she says to the man, unbuckling his seat belt, although the words were more for her than for him. She glances around, memorizing her row and checking that the fire doesn&rsquo;t seem to be an immediate danger to him.</p>
<p>Tabby steps across the aisle to get a sense of what&rsquo;s going on by the emergency exit, and starts to cue in to the harried conversation there. She can&rsquo;t get any closer than the aisle seat of that row.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;what I&rsquo;m <em>doing</em> for Chrissake&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never get it that way, get your—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gethefuck <em>off</em> and let me—&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is going nowhere, Tabby thinks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overcome: 1 Rapport + 2 = 3 (Good) <em>Succeeds</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This is no time to fight, we need cool heads!&rdquo; The unexpected voice interrupts the dynamic of the two men arguing. They turn to look, are suitably impressed by her bandana-mask, and open a little space so she can get at the hatch. &ldquo;I got this, guys.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overcome: 4 Hardware + 0 = 4 (Great) <em>Succeeds with Style</em> +1 boost</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tabby sees immediately how the inflatable slide ties in and makes sure it deploys. Then she steps back and waves the others forward. As soon as she can, she goes back and attempts to wake her row-mate.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s out cold. Tabby sets her core and attempts to carry him across the aisle to safety.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overcome: 2 Physique + 0 + 2 <em>I Just Wanna Help</em> = 4 (Great) <em>Succeeds</em>, -1 fate point</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The strength of her spirit and determination get her and the muderously heavy man to the hatch. One of the flight crew is at the base of the slide, signalling for her to send her burden down. Positioning him as best she can, she lets him go. His head drags along the side of the slide, but he&rsquo;s in no worse shape than he was, assuming he doesn&rsquo;t have a spinal cord injury.</p>
<p>Tabby steps back to look around again. A last few people rush out the hatch, but Tabby can&rsquo;t see anyone else. The heat in the cabin is getting very severe and sweat is running into her eyes and bandana.</p>
<p>Questioning her own judgment, she wades forward through the smoke to make a final check.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overcome: 2 Athletics + 0 = 2 (Fair) <em>Succeeds</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>She doesn&rsquo;t see anyone, and can&rsquo;t hear anything over a roar of fire and occasional screeches of metal. The plane lurches and tilts, and several of the overhead bins drop open, some spilling luggage onto the floor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Situation Aspect: <em>Luggage Everywhere</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could definitely die right now, Tabby thinks, time to go. She turns back to the exit she opened, several rows back.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overcome: 2 Athletics - 1 = 1 (Average) <em>Fails</em>, 1 shift stress from intensifying fire</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hit by a coughing spasm and tripped by a sliding bag, Tabby sprawls to the aisle floor. As she pushes herself up, she realizes its her carry-on: her grandfather&rsquo;s old travel welding kit. In the same moment a gout of fire pierces one of the starboard windows, giving her first degree burns across the back of her neck and arms. She clutches the bag and furiously dives out of the plane, a puff of human-shaped smoke.</p>
<hr />
<p>As the plane comes to a halt and black smoke engulfs the cabin, Sam quickly looks himself over to make sure nothing is broken. Other than a slight pain in his shin and some ringing in his ear, he seems to still be in one piece. He quickly undoes his seat belt and throws his only remaining wireless earbud to the floor—who knows where the other one went.</p>
<p>The woman to his left seems to be slowly coming to her senses—she&rsquo;ll be fine—and the man to his right is fumbling with his seat belt. Sam steps around him and stands in the aisle. As he opens the overhead bin and reaches for his trusty duffel bag, he looks around to see where the smoke is coming from and where he should head to.</p>
<p>Before he can get a good look, a very loud voice behind him screams, &ldquo;NO LUGGAGE!!&rdquo; and suddenly hands are on him.</p>
<div class="character"><p><strong>Steward</strong></p>
<p>Black hair, thick build.</p>
<p><em>My Mean Older Brother Growing Up Knew Jiu-jitsu</em></p></div>

<blockquote>
<p>Defend: 0 Fight - 2 = -2 (Terrible) <em>Fails</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In blur of focused leverage and superior grip, Sam&rsquo;s bag is ripped out of his hands, his shoulders are wrenched around so he is forced to face forward, and a severe knee in the ass sends him stumbling through the first class curtain. The overhead compartment he had opened snaps shut behind him. &ldquo;ABSOLUTELY NO LUGGAGE!! EXIT FORWARD!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam falls to his knees but grabs onto the arm-rest of an empty seat to stop himself falling forward. As he starts pushing himself up, he notices a fancy cell phone under the seat and a small bottle of whiskey in the seat pocket. As he pushes himself up with him left hand, he quickly drops both items into his jacket pocket with his right hand.</p>
<p>As he stands up, he looks back at the steward but can barely see through the black smoke. It looks like he&rsquo;s helping another passenger undo his seat belt. Sam makes his way to the front of the plane where the door is already open with the first class passengers. He follows the line of people jogging away from the plane.</p>
<p>As he&rsquo;s walking with the crowd, Sam takes a second to open his newly acquired bottle of whiskey and downs it. &ldquo;Nothing like some cheap whiskey to clear your head,&rdquo; he thinks, as he looks back at the plane and surveys the scene.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create an Advantage: 2 Notice + 0 = 2 (Fair) <em>Succeeds</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Predictably, there is a crash tender inbound, and as Sam watches, anticipating the pleasant distance of a whiskey buzz, it gets within range of the burning plane and slams on the brakes. Unpredictably, it does not begin doing anything about the fire. Sam stands passively for a moment, convinced he&rsquo;s wrong, but he sees the coated figures inside become more and more agitated, and realizes he has to act.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Situation Aspect: <em>You&rsquo;re Doing it Wrong</em> with 1 free invocation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What Sam <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> see as he stares at the firetruck is a man, just dismounting from the forward slide, wearing a light-colored suit, impossibly-still-in-place dark glasses, and carrying a worn dufflebag, who had been inches from garotting Sam before the assertive Steward intervened.</p>
<div class="character"><p><strong>Mr. Rayban</strong></p>

<p><em>Assassin for the ETA Council</em></p></div>

<hr />
<p>Hal is rattled but level-headed and checks on his neighbors in the row. One is a kid flying alone the other is also a grandma with huge wireless headphones. She too seems pretty calm about the whole thing. The kid is scared. He unbuckles his lap belt and looks around for an exit through the smoke.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overcome: 3 Notice + 0 = 3 (Good) <em>Succeeds</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He sees a tall man moving powerfully to open the emergency exit back and to the left, smoke rushing out into the daylight, while the emergency exits forward and to the left are a tangled mass of people.</p>
<p>Hal steps out into the aisle, intending to blockade it for the old lady to step out. Frantic people are trying to get toward the back.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Defend: 0 Fight - 1 = -1 (Poor) <em>Fails</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He finds himself rudely shoved back into his row. Hal grabs his backpack from under his seat and winks at the kid, &ldquo;S&rsquo;okay, I needed this anyway,&rdquo; hoping to exude confidence and calm her down.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overcome: 1 Rapport + 1 = 2 (Fair) <em>Tie</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The girl takes Hal&rsquo;s hand but also starts sobbing uncontrollably. The old lady hasn&rsquo;t said a word, but her body language declares that she&rsquo;s ready to pounce on a chance to get into that aisle. Hal leads the way a second time, with much greater success. It seems everyone who had noticed the rear exit is out already. Keeping their heads low, the three move quickly back. Hal doesn&rsquo;t let the girl think about the next part; he puts his other hand low on her back and push-pulls her forward until she&rsquo;s half running out the hatch, her wail doppler-shifting all the way down the slide. Two more blinks of an eye and he&rsquo;s out. Helpful passengers are grabbing people&rsquo;s hands and yanking them up as they land. He turns to see his sturdy row-mate perform a perfect legs-in-front cross-armed leap. She dusts off her skirt and stands with Hal&rsquo;s help and says, &ldquo;Diving Team.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="character"><p><strong>Old Lady</strong></p>

</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Marcus has just realized something is very wrong with first responders that have arrived. He&rsquo;s not sure there&rsquo;s anyone left on the plane, but is isn&rsquo;t sure there&rsquo;s not, either, so the fact that nothing is being done about the first is intolerable. The engine looks pretty different than the one&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s worked with, but he&rsquo;s suddenly confident he could be doing better than whoever is operating the thing.</p>
<p>Breathing raggedly, Marcus sprints over to it, praying he can make a better impression on them than he did on the stewardess. He hoarsely shouts that he&rsquo;s FDNY and can help.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overcome: 1 Rapport - 1 + 2 <em>You&rsquo;re Doing it Wrong</em> + 2 <em>FDNY Paramedic</em> = 4 (Great) <em>Ties</em>, -1 fate point</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Marcus shouts into the cabin of the tender from the side step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something wrong with it, I think the pressure—&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other fire fighter jumps in, &ldquo;The pressure&rsquo;s fine, look, you haven&rsquo;t got it set so—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew the old one backwards and forwards&hellip;&rdquo; with each exchange the fire fighters&rsquo; pitch increases and their eyes get wider. The radio is crackling with chatter that Marcus can&rsquo;t make out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me in so I can see what&rsquo;s going on,&rdquo; Marcus interrupts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just come in here and—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That fucking plane—which probably still has people on it—is fucking <em>on fire</em> and you two are standing here holding your dicks! Fucking let me help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shit! Okay. See if you can do better, asshole. Mufid, call—&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marcus slides up and looks around and instantly sees conspicuous indicator lights with clear labels that stand out from the bank controls.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overcome: 4 Lore - 2 = 2 (Fair) <em>Ties</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>His background knowledge and exposure to fire engines combined with the fact that it&rsquo;s practically telling him what to do enable Marcus to deploy the arm and water. However, the arm is aiming somewhat perpendicular to the tender when high-pressure water is suddenly released, which is enough to tip Marcus back out of the cabin, landing him on his ass on the runway.</p>
<p>The fire fighters still inside seem to have caught on to what to do next and they quickly get the arm pointed in the right direction.</p>
<hr />
<p>Sam sees the same curiously ineffective crash tender. He quickly looks at the people next to him in the crowd and singles out a tall young woman wearing a Nike t-shirt and some running shoes who looks calm despite the situation. Sam&rsquo;s mind goes back to his past in the corporate world where he used to be particularly good at schmoozing with higher up to get what he wants. He grabs her attention, flashes a reassuring smile and says: &ldquo;Something seems wrong over there, I think they need help—come with me!&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overcome: 2 Rapport + 1 = 3 (Good) <em>Succeeds with Style</em> +1 boost <em>Love a Man Who Takes Charge</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sam and the young woman need to cover more distance than Marcus to reach the tender and they arrive in time to give him a hand up off the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You alright there mate?&rdquo;&ldquo;</p>
<p>While fighting to catch the breath that just got knocked out of him, Marcus croaks, &ldquo;Ow,&rdquo; and uses the offered assistance to stand up. &ldquo;Thanks for the help. We need to back away from the plane and let them do their job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Sam agrees, &ldquo;But what the hell were they waiting for? What were you doing up there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well they&rsquo;re all over it now; best we just stay out of their way. As to why the hesitation and what I was doing, there&rsquo;s a big difference between training and the real thing. Sometimes you hesitate more than you&rsquo;d like to think you would, even with your training. It&rsquo;s all a mental problem and one I&rsquo;m very familiar with,&rdquo; Marcus holds out his hand to Sam as he introduces himself, &ldquo;Marcus Cain, paramedic with the New York City Fire Department. Thanks again for helping me back on my feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No worries, it&rsquo;s the least I could do. I&rsquo;m Sam, security consultant. And this is&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m Karly Dandleton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice to meet you Karly. So, FDNY paramedic, huh? Nice to have someone like you around, and I guess you&rsquo;re the expert here—anything we can do to help?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These guys have things well in hand at the moment. If you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I&rsquo;m going to get back to the group,&rdquo; Marcus nods down the runway where the flight crew has been coralling passengers. &ldquo;If you want to help, come with me and look over everyone for injuries. I have a feeling a lot of people are in shock and might not be aware of the injuries they&rsquo;ve sustained&hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip;you too, sir, you should really come join the group,&rdquo; and with that, Marcus jogs off.</p>
<p>Sam and Karly turn to see who Marcus was talking to: a well-dressed man wearing sunglasses. At night.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Sam recognizes something oddly familiar about Mr. Rayban&rsquo;s demeanor, something about his steady gait and rigid posture reminds him of the crooks he&rsquo;s had the displeasure of working with far too often.</p>
<p>The man in the suit smiles as he covers a last few steps toward them. The sun has set and the combination of flashing emergency lights and purple twilight is making it hard for Sam to get a good look at his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss, one of the other passengers was asking after you, said they had something you dropped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Karly pats her pockets and says, &ldquo;Oh, shit, my phone! See ya, Sam,&rdquo; and takes off.</p>
<p>Being experienced in deception himself, Sam recognizes the neatness with which this man had just removed Karly from the scene. Finally it strikes him with full clarity. Mr. Rayban is about to try to kill him.</p>

<p>Sam&rsquo;s roll is so good I&rsquo;m going to call this contest, which would normally take place over three exchanges, in just one exchange.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Karly, wait! Is this your phone?&rdquo; Sam shouts. In a single fluid movement, he pulls the phone he picked up in the plane out of his pocket and dials a number.</p>
<p>Having only taken a couple steps, Karly turns back towards Sam. &ldquo;I picked it up on my way down the slide, you must&rsquo;ve dropped it.&rdquo; Sam says, as he tosses it to Karly, who catches it easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be!&rdquo; Karly says, without really looking at it.</p>
<p>As soon as Karly has the phone in her hands, Sam locks eyes with Mr. Rayban and says, speaking rapidly, &ldquo;I know exactly who you work for and I&rsquo;d stop right there if I were you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without breaking eye contact with Mr. Rayban, Sam continues, louder, &ldquo;Karly, I need you to remain calm. If this man takes a single step towards me I want you to call the number I dialed into the phone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the heck is going on Sam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you dial that number, the identities of the very bad people this man works for will be published for everyone to see.&rdquo; Sam pauses, dramatically. &ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t want that now, would we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Acceptable risk, Mr. Dunbar,&rdquo; and with that, Mr. Rayban hurls the bag he&rsquo;s carrying at Sam&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>Sam throws his hands up as the bag comes at his face. One of the straps tangles up his hand and the weight of it puts him off balance. He can&rsquo;t see what Mr. Rayban is doing while he&rsquo;s struggling just to remain standing, but he&rsquo;s sure it isn&rsquo;t good. He trips over his own feet and falls.</p>

<p>Sam swipes the bag off his head in time to see the extremely pissed off and in-motion Steward try to wrap his arms around Mr. Rayban and take him off his feet. Mr. Rayban twists, gets an arm under the grapple and barely manages to shrug it off. Karly screams. Sam watches, paralyzed with surprise.</p>

<p>Mr. Rayban grabs the back of the Steward&rsquo;s shirt to pull him forward and aims a brutal knee at his face, but the Steward shakes his grip and sidesteps. Sam gets his feet set on the ground and starts to get up.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The Steward leaps at Mr. Rayban and lands a nasty right hook on his jaw. Sam is standing—finally—and realizing he better do something.</p>
<p>He screams out and rushes into the fight, hoping to give the appearance of a threat and draw Mr. Rayban&rsquo;s attention away from the Steward.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sam Create an Advantage: 4 Deceive - 1 = 3 (Good) <em>Fails</em></p>
<p>Mr. Rayban Defend: 2 Empathy + 2 = 4 (Great) <em>Succeeds</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, Mr. Rayban has been in for too many fights to be had by such a simple tactic and he hits Sam with a effortless blow to the shoulder, sending Sam stumbling.</p>
<p>In the mean time, Karly, not exactly sure what the heck is going on, rushes to the crash tender and starts banging on the window and gesturing wildly.</p>
<p>Having brushed off Sam, Mr. Rayban turns his body back towards the Steward and, in one smooth motion, sends his left foot straight at the Steward&rsquo;s abdomen.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>The Steward steps back from the kick and grabs Mr. Rayban&rsquo;s ankle, absorbing the blow with very little difficulty. He even looks Mr. Rayban in the eyes and grins a little.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steward Attack: 2 Fight - 3 + 2 <em>This Little Piggy</em> = 1 (Average) <em>Ties</em>, gains boost <em>Throwing You Off Your Game</em>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The Steward pivots in place with the ankle in his hands, aiming to rip Mr. Rayban off his footing, but his grip fails him and Mr. Rayban twists free. Flowing with the motion, he gets his released foot on the ground and aims another kick at the Steward with this other foot.</p>
<p>The kick never lands because Mr. Rayban, the Steward, and Sam are all suddenly forced to the ground by what feels to Sam like a combination of a sand blaster and a jackhammer.</p>
<div class="situation"><p>The three combatants are <em>Soaking Wet</em>.</p></div>

<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Rayban <em>Concedes</em>, +1 fate point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It only lasts a moment, but it&rsquo;s enough to thoroughly disorient Sam. When the world makes sense again, one of the firefighters is leaning over him, helping him up, while talking to the still-prone Steward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why were you idiots fighting? Jesus, we have a burning plane to deal with. And you should know better!&rdquo; he says, now helping the Steward up. &ldquo;Get yourselves over to that ambulance out there, and away from the fire. Hey, were&rsquo;d the other guy go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He and Sam were defending themselves from that psycho!&rdquo; Karly yells, pointing out past the crash tender, but her expression turns quizzical as she realizes she can&rsquo;t actually see him, which is confusing in the huge open space of the runyway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ok guys, let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Same says, looking around suspiciously, &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be safer with a group.&rdquo; Sam looks at the Steward, &ldquo;And thanks, uh&hellip;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ramón. You&rsquo;re welcome. I have a problem with bullies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More like bullies have a problem with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ramón smiles. &ldquo;Usually, yeah. Here&rsquo;s your bag, for what it&rsquo;s worth.&rdquo; Ramón hands Sam a heavy, dripping-wet duffel. &ldquo;And seriously, don&rsquo;t go for your stuff in an evacuation, its dangerous,&rdquo; he says, looking Sam hard in the eye, and hanging onto the duffel for a long second as Sam takes it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right. Won&rsquo;t happen again. Scout&rsquo;s honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ramón grunts. He and Sam and Karly walk together in exhausted silence toward the ambulance.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hal, seeing the old lady is all in one piece, turns to check on the girl he ushered out. She&rsquo;s walking away from them both, listing a bit, and still sobbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey kiddo, you alright?&rdquo; he calls after her, but she doesn&rsquo;t respond. Just as he&rsquo;s shifting he weight to jog after her, the old lady puts a hand on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be a dear and walk with me. We&rsquo;ll talk to her together,&rdquo; she says. Hal gives the her his arm. &ldquo;Sweetheart, wait for us,&rdquo; she calls in a louder voice. The girl stops and and turns, wringing her hands. As they catch up with her, a couple jogs across their path toward the rear of the plane. Hal thinks they&rsquo;re heading for the fire-truck-thing that has just showed up, but his attention is focused here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Hal, good to meet you,&rdquo; Hal says to his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mauve, likewise,&rdquo; she says, patting his hand, but without taking her eyes of the girl. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been very brave, sweetheart. I can take care of you for now, don&rsquo;t you worry. We&rsquo;ll make some calls, have a lie down, and things will be fine before you know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl stands frozen for a moment with big eyes. Then she breaks into fresh wails and throws her arms around Mauve. The old lady waves off Hal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be fine, dearie. You go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal feels like Mauve is handling the immediate sitation better than he could, so we winks at her and turns to survey the destruction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You two just help each other away from the plane, get to a safe distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s right, sweetheart, let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; and the pair set off slowly.</p>
<p>Hal pulls his phone out of his pocket and a huge grin comes to his face when he discovers it&rsquo;s undamaged. He flips up twitter and starts to take a picture when the app recommends he try to get more of the burning plane in frame. &ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; he thinks, and jogs away a bit more.</p>

<p>He sees that they&rsquo;re trying to put out the fire now, but wonders where the EMTs are. As he looks around he sees flashing lights in the distance. It&rsquo;s an ambulance; it will be a minute before it arrives. But something about the people nearby catches his attention. Most are wandering away down the runway, or sitting down at a healthy distance, but one man in a suit is walking along the plane toward the crash tender.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Something is off about that guy, Hal thinks. But he&rsquo;s more interested in getting off this dark, hot, smokey, uncomfortable runway. He starts walking toward the main group of passengers, the direction Mauve and the girl went, with the intention of getting to a hotel as directly as possible.</p>
<p>As he walks he dials his brother, who answers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey Hal, what&rsquo;s up man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey Dylan. Calling to let you know I&rsquo;m okay; my plane just crashed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh, what the fuck? You&rsquo;re&hellip; okay, you just said you&rsquo;re okay. What do you mean, crashed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking at it,&rdquo; Hal says, turning to look over his shoulder, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s fucked up and on fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy shit. Holy shit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, you slid down the inflatable slide and all that shit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yup, all that shit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa. But how can you be okay? You said it&rsquo;s on fire? Like, it blew up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kind of. It never really took off. It got going a bit but then tipped over and just one wing exploded, or something. We didn&rsquo;t, like, fall out of the sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy shit man, I&rsquo;m seriously glad you&rsquo;re okay. What the fuck? Planes don&rsquo;t just crash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you need anything? They&rsquo;re going to take you back&hellip; I dunno, you can&rsquo;t call a lyft and be like &lsquo;I&rsquo;m standing on a runway.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m being an idiot, I guess just do you need anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, man, thanks. They&rsquo;ve got to send ambulances or one of those parking shuttles or something, then I&rsquo;m going to get a hotel room and chill for awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, okay, sure. Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I mean, I haven&rsquo;t been in a plane crash lately, so yeah, I&rsquo;m good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seriously, Dylan. I&rsquo;m fine anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;m fine. Hea&rsquo;s been having a tough time today, which is making life a little hard. She&rsquo;s been real frustrated, then she got this big rash, which made her more frustrated. I&rsquo;ve been trying to give her space. Everyone has a bad day sometimes. Like my brother who crashes planes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hilarious. Okay, well, that&rsquo;s too bad, I hope it&rsquo;s nothing serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nah, allergies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, well say hi to her for me. I&rsquo;m going to call work and get some time off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds good. Okay man, see ya. And take care of yourself. Don&rsquo;t drive yourself anywhere for awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, I&rsquo;m fine. But yeah, see ya Dylan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal is now amongst the other passengers, and scene looks straight out of a television show with the ambulance&rsquo;s headlights pouring over part of the crowd, and the blue and red lights strobing. It doesn&rsquo;t look like there is anything but the one ambulance and he doesn&rsquo;t expect the EMTs are about to shuttle him anywhere.</p>

<p>As Hal is wondering how dangerous it is to just start walking across possibly active runways in order to get back to the terminal when he overhears the two uniformed EMTs working through the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rash here too, mid torso, left side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel fine. What you mean &lsquo;here too&rsquo;, do I have something infectious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re feeling fine then don&rsquo;t worry about it, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<hr />
<div class="situation"><p><strong>Runway With Passengers</strong></p>
<p><em>Dark</em>, <em>Injured or Shocked People</em></p></div>

<p>As some of Tabby&rsquo;s adrenaline starts to subside, making her a little shaky as she lets herself be herded by the flight crew with the other passengers, she starts to realize just how much the burns on her neck and arms hurt. Sure would be nice to get some ibuprophen, she thinks, and looks around the ragged mass of people for an EMT or at least someone that looks like they may know what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>No such luck at the moment. Really strange that there aren&rsquo;t all kinds of cars rushing out here, Tabby thinks, we <em>were</em> just in a plane crash. She gets busy checking on people and generally being nice and supportive, which helps her relax.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; a man says as he walks up to her, extending his hand to shake. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an EMT, I was on the plane. Marcus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tabby. You&rsquo;re an EMT! Great, this is Lin,&rdquo; Tabby says, introducing the woman she&rsquo;s been talking to, &ldquo;you should have a look at her—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, no offsense, and my apologies Lin, but I can see from here she&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;d like your help with something else, Tabby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh, yeah, sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell you&rsquo;re good with people. I need you to go around and see everyone, calmly but quickly, and look for anything that really worries you. If you find anything, stay with them until I come back or they receive medical attention. It&rsquo;s important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tabby looks at Lin, who smiles and says she&rsquo;s fine. Tabby&rsquo;s a little miffed at being bossed around, but also really pleased to feel so useful and important. She also notices, through the gathering dark, that an ambulance is coming down the runway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t wait for them, some people might need help right away. I&rsquo;ll go this direction,&rdquo; Marcus says, pointing a thumb back over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, Marcus,&rdquo; she says, cementing his name in her memory, &ldquo;sure thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tabby begins greeting passengers and asking after them. The first several she talks to are distant or dazed but responsive and not visibly harmed. Then she gets to a couple, a old woman and a young girl. The woman has found a piece of luggage to sit on and the girl is leaning against her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi you two, I&rsquo;m Tabby. I&rsquo;m checking in on everyone to make sure you&rsquo;re alright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman makes eye contact and says, &ldquo;Hi Tabby, I&rsquo;m Mauve, and this is Celia. Would you take a look at this please?&rdquo; Tabby steps closer. &ldquo;Honey let me move your shirt just a little so we can make sure you&rsquo;re alright.&rdquo; Mauve lifts the hem of Celia&rsquo;s shirt a few inches and Tabby, who has the light on her phone handy, sees a bright red splotch on the girl&rsquo;s skin.</p>
<p>Without touching anything, Tabby asks, &ldquo;Does that hurt, honey?&rdquo; Celia shakes her head no. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure? It doesn&rsquo;t itch or anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Celia says, quietly.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;She seems alright to me, Mauve, just shaken up. Would you like me to go get someone to take a second look?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no. Thank you. We&rsquo;ll just wait with everyone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tabby nods and says her farewells and continues through the crowd. The ambulance arrives with two uniformed EMTs who start examining people—much more quickly than Tabby is, she realizes—at the periphery. She&rsquo;s come across a dozen people at this point with some kind of splotchy rash, some on their shoulders or neck, some on their forearms and tops of their hands. None of them are upset about it and some blame it on the smoke or the stress. But she works her way toward the EMTs with the intent to share this with them.</p>
<hr />
<p>As Marcus attends to the many wandering shocked individuals from the plane crash he too has noticed the red blotches that Tabby did. He recognizes it&rsquo;s unusual and atypical of a fire-related injury. It must be something tangentially related to the plane crash. Growing increasingly concerned, Marcus investigates his own body closely.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create an Advantage: 0 Notice + 0 = 0 <em>Ties</em>, gains boost <em>I Seem Fine</em></p>

<p>He doesn’t see anything out of the ordinary and breathes a sigh of relief.
Spotting the arrival of the paramedics, he rushes over to them and flashes his credentials before explaining</p>

<p>Marcus wastes no time negotiating pecking orders and launches into his primary concern. The EMTs recognize the command he has of the situation and look up from their patients to listen attentively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a more concerning issue than just this fire here. There are red rashes on people that are not burns and appear to have all shown up since after the crash from what I can discern. Make a call to the airport—we need to know if something special was being carried on this plane. In the meantime, all of these people, myself, yourselves, and the firefighters too, need to be quarantined until we identify the malignancy of this rash. I understand clearly that I cannot make this call, so get on your radio and explain what I&rsquo;m telling you to the one who can.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overcome: 1 Rapport + 0 + 2 <em>I Know What I&rsquo;m Talking About</em> &#9745; &#9744; = 3 (Good) <em>Succeeds</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The EMTs both nod vigorously and then shake their heads and then nod some more. However several nearby passengers overhear Marcus and visibly react to the word &ldquo;quarantine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good call. I can radio back from the truck. But I also wanna know,&rdquo; Naoto lowers his voice as he realizes there&rsquo;s a frission in the crowd, and they are the epicenter, &ldquo;who has this and who doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Naoto whispers, looking to his partner, Carol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. I haven&rsquo;t found anyone who <em>hasn&rsquo;t</em> had it yet. But no other signs of allergic reaction,&rdquo; Carol says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m one,&rdquo; Marcus says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No rash?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, I guess that&rsquo;s encouraging. Here,&rdquo; Carol pulls a memo pad and a pen from her extremely well-organized bag, &ldquo;take names of anyone who&rsquo;s rash free, and let us know immediately if you see anything remotely like anaphylaxis. The rash could just be a lead-in.&rdquo; Naoto nods and briskly walks back toward the ambulance.</p>
<p>As Marcus turns to sort out which people he&rsquo;s going to work with next, Tabby comes up to him. She pinches his elbow, turns him away from the people closest to them, and whispers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been seeing people with a painless rash?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. We,&rdquo; Marcus gestures toward Carol, who already has a blood pressure cuff on one passenger and is asking questions of another, &ldquo;just talked about it. Everyone they&rsquo;ve seen or I&rsquo;ve seen has it. Except me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, same here. Oh, and I don&rsquo;t have it either,&rdquo; Marcus&rsquo; eyebrows go up a little and he nods, &ldquo;but also,&rdquo; Tabby lowers her voice but sets her eyebrows in her &ldquo;serious face&rdquo; as she addresses Marcus. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you should keep your voice down about the quarantine talk? These people are already traumatized and emotional. We don&rsquo;t need a hysterical mob on our hands, especially since there&rsquo;s still not enough help out here to care for them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marcus frowns, clearly not enjoying the fact that Tabby has a point. He opens his mouth to rebut her but stops and shakes his head. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re right, but the fact is we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happening here, except that it&rsquo;s no coincidence.&rdquo; He looks around the crowd and adds, &ldquo;I wish we could announce to everyone that everything is fine, but it&rsquo;s not. There&rsquo;s nowhere for any of us to go, anyway; I think everyone&rsquo;s doing ok, considered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tabby also looks around and doesn&rsquo;t see any signs of panic. &ldquo;Yeah, everything considered. Who haven&rsquo;t you talked to yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marcus points to another lobe of the crowd in the direction of the plane, and Tabby moves that way.</p>
<hr />
<p>&ldquo;So, Ramón, how does a flight attendant know how to fight so well?&rdquo; Sam asks, before pulling the polo over his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Growing up, my brother knew jiu-jitsu, I kind of picked it up along the way I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who the hell was that man, Sam?&rdquo; Karly asks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not exactly sure who <em>he</em> was, but I have a very good hunch I know who he was working for. Over the years I&rsquo;ve made quite a few enemies on the wrong side of the law—that comes with the job description I suppose—but I&rsquo;ve never been attacked before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <em>is</em> your job description?&rdquo; Karly asked, looking like she was a little afraid of the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, uh,&rdquo; Sam rubbed the back of his neck. &ldquo;Security systems, I do security systems. Like set them up for museums, companies, stuff like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh. So what was all that stuff you said about the calling the phone number?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that was nothing. I was just trying to distract him. Are you alright, Karly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a little unsettled by all this,&rdquo; she says, as she gestures to the scene around them, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll be fine, all things considered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about you, Ramón?&rdquo; Sam asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been worse. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind a dry change of clothes. Shouldn&rsquo;t there be a bus or something here by now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Karly adds, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go check the ambulance, maybe someone&rsquo;ll knows something. They might even have blankets to dry yourselves off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The group walks over to the ambulance, leaving two trail of puddles behind them. When they are most of the way there, they notice a woman breaking away from the crowd and coming to meet them.</p>
<p>Tabby looks them over with a worried but warm smile as they approach, and immediately speaks up, &ldquo;Hi, how is your skin??&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ramon replies, &ldquo;At the moment, wet mostly. You guys have any dry clothes in that ambulance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, dry clothes would be great,&rdquo; Sam agrees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a second,&rdquo; Karly says, &ldquo;What was that about our skin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m helping the EMTs check everyone out. The most common injury so far is burns or scrapes,&rdquo; Tabby explains.</p>
<p>Ramón, Sam, and Karly twist their arms this way and that and pat themselves a little. Sam and Karly report feeling fine, Ramón explains he picked up a scrape or two on his knuckles but is otherwise okay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to check more thoroughly, if you don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; Tabby says as she gestures with her phone&rsquo;s light, &ldquo;sometimes with all the adrenaline you can miss things.&rdquo; She makes light of the situation by asking their names and making comments like, &ldquo;can you believe all this&rdquo; and &ldquo;so glad you all made it out safely&rdquo; while mixing in &ldquo;just pull back your sleeve there&rdquo; and &ldquo;how&rsquo;s about back here&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ramón, you&rsquo;ve got a nasty rash all down your back!&rdquo; Karly exclaims.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got something similar, Karly,&rdquo; Tabby points out. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see anything on Sam though.&rdquo; She steps back and puts her hands on her hips. &ldquo;Okay. So you all want some dry clothes. Come on with me and we&rsquo;ll see what they&rsquo;ve got in the ambulance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rest of the group shrug and nod and start walking.</p>
<div class="situation"><p>Ambulance</p>
<p>One EMT, Naoto, in the cab.</p>
<p><em>Radio On The Fritz</em></p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, how&rsquo;s it going in there? We&rsquo;ve got some people who need to dry off,&rdquo; Tabby says as she approaches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, yeah, yeah. Blankets and towels in the back, right side, down low, blue drawer,&rdquo; Naoto replies, dividing his attention from what he&rsquo;s doing with some effort. Sam and Ramón hop into action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got some more info on who is and isn&rsquo;t affected,&rdquo; Tabby says, peering into the cab, &ldquo;you need any help in there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trying to hail&hellip; well, anyone. We need shuttles, cops, cleanup&hellip; the whole ERP seems to be shit at the moment, just like this radio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;ERP?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emergency Response Plan. Ugh, screw this thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man Karly and Tabby hadn&rsquo;t noticed, standing bit outside the main floodlight, speaks up, &ldquo;I might be able to help with the radio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all turn as Hal takes one step forward so he can be seen more clearly. He&rsquo;s tall and a little soft around the edges. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve worked with them before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look&hellip; oh, why the hell not. We need to get through somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man nods to Karly and Tabby as he gets in the cab and Naoto switches to the passenger seat, &ldquo;Ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overcome: 3 Hardware + 1 = 4 (Great) <em>Succeeds with Style</em>, gains boost <em>Made It Look Easy</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You just need to have this plugged in here instead of,&rdquo; and Hal moves the hand mic&rsquo;s plug into another jack, &ldquo;and there ya go,&rdquo; he says, offering the mic to Naoto, who excitedly snaps it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dispatch, Dispatch, this is 2497, come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;2497 this is Dispatch, go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got all of flight 4811 standing around here on the tarmac. Where are you guys, over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roger, stand by on that. Any trouble with the equipment, over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say again, Dispatch, over,&rdquo; Naoto scowls in confusion as he thumbs the mic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2497 have you had any trouble with your equipment, over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Affirmative, the radio was some trouble, yeah, over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who fixed it, over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the&hellip;&rdquo; Naoto says, without keying the talk button. He looks at Hal, who shrugs. &ldquo;A passenger, over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;2497 require that you keep the passenger near the radio, over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roger,&rdquo; Naoto pauses and shakes his head a tiny bit as if to wake himself up, &ldquo;&hellip;wilco. And what about the other thing? Over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand by. This is wilco alpha charlie four oh, over and out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fuck?&rdquo; Naoto sits with the mic still poised near his face. He looks at Hal again, who shrugs again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name&rsquo;s Hal,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, thanks for fixing the radio, Hal. You have any problem hanging out in the seat there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo; Naoto puts the mic down and picks up his bag. &ldquo;Uh, Hal, how are you doing? Any injuries?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh, maybe a bruise here or there. Not really.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any rash? On your arms or under your shirt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal looked at his arms, &ldquo;I feel fine. You want me to lift my shirt?&rdquo; Naoto nods. Hal leaned forward and pulls the back of his shirt up to his neck and twists left and right for Naoto to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ok, great, looks good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Karly and Tabby, who have been leaning against the outside of the ambulance, chatting quietly, notice the radio go quiet. Karly stands up and looks into the cab. &ldquo;What&rsquo;d they say?&rdquo; she asks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That we have to wait longer,&rdquo; Naoto says, as he walks around the front of the ambulance toward them.</p>
<p>Marcus and Carol part from the crowd, aiming for Naoto. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a short list,&rdquo; Carol says. &ldquo;Marcus here. That&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Tabby Charmichael, who was helping me before you guys got here,&rdquo; Marcus adds, as Tabby walks up from behind the ambulance with Sam and Ramón in tow, with towels and messy hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This guy, too,&rdquo; Naoto says, &ldquo;Hal&hellip;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harold Brimhall,&rdquo; Hal says, &ldquo;but call me Hal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Sam,&rdquo; Tabby says, quick on the inference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we talking about?&rdquo; Sam asks.</p>
<p>Before anyone can answer, the radio crackles. &ldquo;2497, 2497, this is wilco alpha charlie four oh, come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind?&rdquo; Hal says to Naoto and Carol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh—&rdquo; Carol raises a hand to stop Hal, but Naoto cuts in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine Carol. Dispatch wants to talk him, hell if I know why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal reaches for the mic, standing half in and half out of the ambulance cab. &ldquo;Dispatch this is 2497, helpful passenger speaking, go ahead,&rdquo; Hal says smoothly into the mic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is FEMA R4 Deputy Regional Administrator Sariah Kendrick, thanks for getting on. Can you confirm the EMTs have been finding a rash on all the passengers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Affirmative, I can put one of them on, over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No no, I want to talk to you. What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hal Bailman, over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And can you also confirm you don&rsquo;t have it? The rash?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Affirmative, over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. Okay.&rdquo; There was a lengthy pause, and Hal wasn&rsquo;t sure if he should speak. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re sending a squad car for you. I need you to follow the officer&rsquo;s instructions when they get there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are at least three others here who are unaffected, over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Hal says this it finally occurs to Naoto and Carol to check their own bodies. They quickly find the rash on themselves as well. They look at their skin, and then at each other, and both breathe out &ldquo;fuuuuuuck&rdquo; simultaneously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that? Repeat that. How many?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marcus holds up four fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dispatch we have four unaffected people right here, and an unknown,&rdquo; Marcus makes a slicing gesture and shakes his head emphatically, &ldquo;correction, we have a total of four. Everyone else has been checked out, over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh my god. Okay.&rdquo; Another pause. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re sending two squad cars. The four people you mentioned are to get in those cars. Is that understood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal doesn&rsquo;t respond right away, but looks around those gathered. Sam manages to look a little green despite the flashing red lights. The rest just look very surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;d all like to know what&rsquo;s going on before we do that, over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The officers will explain when they get there. That&rsquo;s all, um,&rdquo; a quick silence, &ldquo;Out. Over and out.&rdquo;</p>

            

            <div id="rash_decisions" class="bookmark"></div>

            <h2>Rash Decisions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Unused boosts expire</p>
<p>Stress clears</p>
<p>Situation: <em>Dark</em>, <em>Five-Oh Inbound</em></p>
<p>NPCs: Ramón, Karly, Naoto, Carol, over a hundred nervous passengers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s a short stunned silence in the group as the radio cuts off.</p>
<p>Tabby had been listening intently as Hal spoke to the FEMA person on the other end of the radio, listening for voice inflection, hesitation, or confusion. She notices she hadn&rsquo;t been using radio jargon like Hal had been. And the way she had paused and stuttered at times is giving Tabby the impression she was improvising, as if she has been forced to step up and take over even though it&rsquo;s not natural.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As weird as this is, something even stranger is going on over there,&rdquo; Tabby says, gesturing at the radio. &ldquo;That woman isn&rsquo;t used to this. Calling the shots, or whatever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marcus is still staring into the cab of the ambulance, as if waiting to hear something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weird that there isn&rsquo;t more chatter on that frequency. Hal, maybe try the other channels to see what&rsquo;s what,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>Hal obliges and tunes the radio up and down the band listening for heightened voices or anything seemingly related to the crash or rash. There are other dispatchers and responders on other frequencies. There&rsquo;s lots of jargon mixed in and it&rsquo;s difficult to understand.</p>
<p>A thought occurs to Hal and he slowly takes his hands off the radio with his palms open and forward. Asking everyone and no one, he offers to the group gathered, &ldquo;Do we have any idea or sense about how people are contracting this rash?&rdquo; His manners fail him and his eyes stop on Naoto.</p>
<p>Naoto grunts, too distracted to be much insulted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been touching and breathing the same stuff as everyone else. The radio is the least of your worries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, uh&hellip; yeah, sorry. Can you make anything out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Naoto frowns. &ldquo;Some of those are calls asking for other districts to lend support with their units. Otherwise typical stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marcus turns to the others with visible impatience. &ldquo;We should be able to find references to the crash as a breaking news story by now—some of us should check that on our phones. It would also help us discern if there is something larger afoot than just our plane crash. For instance, it strikes me as unusual and unlikely that a deputy regional administrator from FEMA is at emergency dispatch for the airport for a plane crash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; Sam says. &ldquo;Karly, you mind checking social media? Surely someone has posted something, maybe American Airlines or RDU has responded. I&rsquo;ll check news sites and other communications.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ramón shrugs and says he doesn&rsquo;t have his phone. &ldquo;Because <em>I</em> left my luggage on the plane,&rdquo; he adds, a little louder than necessary. Tabby and Karly get their phones out while Hal continues exploring the radio chatter.</p>
<p>Sam rummages through his bag and pulls out a small, rugged, almost military-looking tablet. He wipes off a few water drops with his shirt, the screen turns on and shows a lock screen for a couple seconds before springing to life.</p>
<p>Sam opens an app, hits &ldquo;scan all frequencies&rdquo; and a radar-like scanning icon is displayed momentarily before he swipes over to a news app, types in RDU and starts scrolling through the most recent news articles.</p>
<p>While the others are working, Marcus looks around the crowd to see if any of the passengers are using technology, expecting them to be calling loved ones or doing just what his companions are doing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create an Advantage: 2 Notice + 0 = 2 (Fair) <em>Success</em>, discovers aspect <em>Darn Technology</em> &#9744;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He notices that most people <em>aren&rsquo;t</em> on their devices. The ones that are are mildly agitated, shaking their heads or commenting to those next to them, as if to say, &ldquo;can you believe this thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ramón disappears behind the ambulance but quickly comes back. He&rsquo;s taken off his wet steward shirt and is wearing a reflective jacket with EMT logos on it. He walks over to the group while drying his hair in a towel.</p>
<p>Sam looks up from this laptop and gives him a quizzical look. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a steward, a jiu-jitsu ninja <em>and</em> an EMT?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ramon chuckles a little. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only shirt I found.&rdquo; Sam returns to his laptop, and Ramón catches Carol&rsquo;s eye. &ldquo;Excuse me, I&rsquo;m still worried, what do we know about this rash? Does it look like it&rsquo;s stress induced? Allergies? Could it be from the heat and smoke? Does it look like anything you&rsquo;ve seen before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Carol says, sighing, &ldquo;it could be any of that. People get rashes for all kinds of reasons and you usually never know why, they just go away. But all at once, on everyone? Beats me. I just make sure people are stable and call it in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half-panicked passenger comes over to Carol rattling off question after question, and she turns away from Ramón to intercept and calm them.</p>
<p>After a minute or 2 looking at news headlines, Sam switches to his scanning app, quickly glances over the results and doesn&rsquo;t notice anything out of the ordinary. He locks his tablet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only mention of the crash is on CNN,&rdquo; Sam says, &ldquo;but there is quite literally zero information other than &lsquo;a crash has been reported&rsquo;. You find anything Karly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh, no. There&rsquo;s something wrong with my Twitter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few people tweeted,&rdquo; Tabby adds, &ldquo;other passengers I guess. One guy even took a pretty sweet photo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, thanks,&rdquo; Hal says from the cab with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Ha, yeah, that&rsquo;s you, Hal. Nice. But no, nothing from the airport or the airline.&rdquo; Tabby stops for a second and lets out a sharp laugh. &ldquo;Ha. Get this&hellip; Our flight is marked as <em>&lsquo;Delayed&rsquo;</em>.&rdquo; She looks up at Sam with an incredulous look on her face. &ldquo;And practically all other flights from here are either delayed or cancelled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ok, that&rsquo;s weird, but it could be normal for an emergency,&rdquo; Sam points out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, but,&rdquo; Hal starts with a loud worried voice, which he quickly reduces to a whisper, &ldquo;targeted extraction of four people from a hundred or so, last-chopper-out-of-Saigon-style, is definitely not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without so much as a hot cocoa or a blanket,&rdquo; Marcus adds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you guys actually going to go with them?&rdquo; Karly asks.</p>
<p>Nobody can think of how to answer Karly&rsquo;s question for a bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, everyone, coming through!&rdquo; Mauve says clearly as she walks toward the ambulance from the crowd, still with her arm around the young girl. &ldquo;Susan is going to have a sit-down right in there.&rdquo; Carol is out of sight, and Naoto shows no inclination to get in Mauve&rsquo;s way. &ldquo;Lend me your jacket, young man,&rdquo; she says to Ramón, who promptly hands it over. &ldquo;There, honey, it&rsquo;s getting a little cooler and you&rsquo;ll want this,&rdquo; she says as she wraps it around Susan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I think we&rsquo;ve been here long enough,&rdquo; Mauve says to Naoto. How she knows Naoto is the one to speak to and not Ramón isn&rsquo;t at all obvious. &ldquo;No sense in waiting. I&rsquo;ve talked to some very nice people here and most of them are fine to travel, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll agree. We can fit a dozen in this great buggy, all cozy. A couple of trips back and forth won&rsquo;t take a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am we need to be on hand in case someone&rsquo;s condition changes suddenly,&rdquo; Naoto says, shaking his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do understand, my dear. And I know your partner over there can handle it. But <em>my</em> condition is elderly and tired and it&rsquo;s at risk of changing suddenly to serious pain your derriér,&rdquo; Mauve rubs Susan&rsquo;s shoulder as she says this to make it clear she&rsquo;s worried about more than herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve checked over most myself,&rdquo; Marcus says to Naoto, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve been watching; nobody&rsquo;s doing that badly. I think getting everyone out of here, even if it&rsquo;s not the fastest way, is a pretty good idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful,&rdquo; Mauve says, as if its been decided, &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; she says to Ramón, &ldquo;please go let everyone know they&rsquo;ll have a turn, and the good doctors will prioritize who gets on,&rdquo; and with that Mauve turns to fuss over Susan, clearly feeling her job has been done.</p>
<p>With Karly&rsquo;s question still hanging awkwardly over the conversation, Sam points into the distance where two sets of emergency lights emerge from the dark. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>Everyone turns to see. After staring and squinting a bit, it&rsquo;s clear there are three pairs of headlights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmph,&rdquo; says Ramón, not impressed. He turns on his heel and starts using his Steward-voice with the crowd. &ldquo;Everyone who can hear me, please gather around! Gather in, people, that&rsquo;s it. We&rsquo;re going to get some of the worst-off folks into the ambulance and back to the terminal. Please assist anyone who is having trouble walking or standing&hellip;&ldquo;</p>
<p>Hal looks between Tabby, Marcus, and Sam, trying to gauge their reactions. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not at all sure this is a good idea. I want to go home, not to a police station. I&rsquo;m willing to hear what they have to say, but unless I&rsquo;m under arrest&hellip;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds right,&rdquo; agrees Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, guys, they&rsquo;re not coming out here specifically for us without some <em>very good</em> reason. They don&rsquo;t even know our names,&rdquo; Marcus smirks at Hal, &ldquo;not even &lsquo;Mr. Bailman&rsquo; here. I&rsquo;m guessing they need our help with something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, like you said, they don&rsquo;t know us, why would they want us? To help with what?&rdquo; Tabby asks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This might sound silly, but I was in New York on 9/11, and this feels a little like that. There was this time where no one was sure exactly what was going on, how bad it was. But we knew it was bad. I watched people put absolutely everything on hold and go&hellip;&rdquo; Marcus trails off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus!&rdquo; Sam says, &ldquo;You think something like 9/11 is going on out there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fucking <em>FEMA</em>,&rdquo; Hal says quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we go,&rdquo; Tabby says, nodding toward the vehicles pulling up. There are two squad cars and a shuttle bus with &ldquo;Dollar&rdquo; written on the side. One uniformed officer gets out of each car, and the bus driver stays put. The added headlight beams change the position of all the shadows and make it feel like they are suddenly in a different place.</p>
<div class="character"><p>Sergeant William Dustice, ???</p>
<p>Dark uniforms, full police gear.</p>
<p><em>Determined to Follow Orders</em>, <em>Arm of the Law</em></p></div>

<p>The officers walk forward with that easy-but-careful stroll of police assessing a scene, coming straight toward the four while scanning all around. They stop at a conversational distance, one man beside and slightly behind the other. They don&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
<p>Tabby breaks first. &ldquo;Good evening, officers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They both nod, and the man in front, with three stripes on his sleeve, says, &ldquo;Evening. Glad to see so few people are hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ramón comes walking briskly up and says, &ldquo;Is that shuttle for us? We&rsquo;ve got a lot of people who want to get out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go right ahead,&rdquo; the Sergeant days, but he doesn&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great,&rdquo; Ramón says and goes to talk to the bus driver.</p>
<p>Sam clear his throat, but doesn&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you want to tell us what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Hal asks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You the four that dispatch mentioned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s us,&rdquo; Marcus says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, we can fill you in. Just step over here to the cars.&rdquo; Each of the four do their own idiosyncratic version of a deep breath and follow the cops over to the cars. The same Sergeant starts speaking quietly, forcing them to form a tight circle so they can hear him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t very much information. But it seems like the rash is very wide spread. Deputy Kendrick is working to gather everyone who is not affected for special assignments. You&rsquo;re to take these two units,&rdquo; the Sergeant gestures at the cars, &ldquo;and get on I-40. Deputy Kendrick will get in touch over the radio with next steps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam, who has put his tablet away and slung his duffel bag over his shoulder, says &ldquo;Wait, you&rsquo;re saying WE get to drive the cop cars?? Now <em>that</em> I&rsquo;m ok with!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tabby&rsquo;s eyes light up. &ldquo;So what are <em>you</em> going to do?&rdquo; she asks the police officers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be assisting everyone here getting to the terminal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam turns to Karly and says, &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ll be going with Ramón and the other passengers. Give me your number and we can get a drink when all this blows over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright, stay safe. I&rsquo;m gonna go drive in a cop car!&rdquo; Sam grins.</p>
<p>Karly heads off with Ramón towards the bus. Sam turns back to the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These officers might not actually know anything more. I&rsquo;m gonna go talk to this Kendrick person over the radio—get right to the source.&rdquo; he says, as he starts walking towards the nearest squad car.</p>
<p>Marcus puts out a hand and calmly but firmly interrupts Sam&rsquo;s swagger forward.</p>
<p>Sam smiles as if he was never serious anyway. Marcus addresses both officers, frowning slightly. &ldquo;We were led to believe you&rsquo;d have more information about the bigger picture of what is going on—is this all you can tell us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sergeant crosses his arms and doesn&rsquo;t speak at first. He takes a deep breath. &ldquo;I get that you&rsquo;re concerned,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I can tell you this is important.&rdquo; His arms stay crossed.</p>
<p>Deadpan, Hal adds, &ldquo;pretty please. With sugar on top. The fuck is going on?&rdquo; This gets a glance from the Sergeant, but nothing else.</p>
<p>Marcus takes a small step forward and offers his right hand as he introduces himself and flashes his credentials with his left. &ldquo;Marcus Cain, FDNY. I understand that you might be light on information right now. We&rsquo;ve all only just gotten off that plane still on fire behind me so, understandably, we&rsquo;re a bit on edge—more so with the added strangeness. Mind if we ask you a few questions? All we hope for is your honest appraisal. You look to have been on the job for a bit sergeant so let&rsquo;s start with what your gut is telling you. If need be, you can tell it to me and I can filter it to the rest, I filter well.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marcus Create an Advantage: 1 Rapport + 3 = 4 (Great) <em>Success</em>, creates aspect for Sergeant, <em>One of the Brotherhood</em> &#9744;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Sergeant&rsquo;s arms come down and he hooks his thumbs in his belt. &ldquo;No, no. No need for a filter. Everyone&rsquo;s got at right to the basics, which is, number one, we absolutely cannot make the mistake of letting our imaginations get carried away here. Number two, this isn&rsquo;t anything anyone has seen before. Not that we can&rsquo;t handle it, mind you. But what we need right now is for certain folks such as yourselves who are handling everything well to lend their assistance. The Deputy is calling the shots for the local districts, at least for now, and I&rsquo;m in direct command of forces here at the airport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a brief pause while everyone takes this in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In any case,&rdquo; the Sergeant continues, &ldquo;I need to see ID and and get numbers from each of you.</p>
<p>Marcus hands his over, which he already had out, without comment. The Sergeant takes it and looks expectantly at the others.</p>
<p>Marcus turns first to Sam and then the others. &ldquo;Come on, it sounds like the quicker we cooperate the quicker we will figure out how we all get home.&rdquo; Turning back to the officer, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s highly irregular to be asking for civilian help—your call or FEMA&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Correct, sir, it is. Thank you,&rdquo; he says as he hands back Marcus&rsquo; ID. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d agree that some of the things you&rsquo;ve seen tonight are irregular. Originally the Deputy&rsquo;s call but she consulted me and my CO and we&rsquo;re all in agreement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever lets me drive around in a cop car!&rdquo; Sam grins as he pulls out his passport with the boarding pass still in it. &ldquo;I guess this is useless now&hellip;&rdquo;
He crumples up the boarding pass, stuffs it in his pocket and hands his passport over to the sergeant.</p>
<p>Tabby fumbles around in her bag and pulls out a blue plastic Hello Kitty wallet. She removes her ID and hands it to the officer with a self-aware smile. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that everything today is a new experience for all of us. Not that we can&rsquo;t handle it,&rdquo; she tacks on with a nod and wink.</p>
<p>Hal nods politely and hands over his license as well, all the while intently studying both officers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because Sam is a <em>Security Systems Neutralizer For Hire</em> it makes sense the police recognize his name. Damn his luck. +1 fate point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Sergeant, studying Sam&rsquo;s passport, smiles with just the side of his mouth and says, &ldquo;Dunbar. Hey Phil, look at this,&rdquo; as he passes it back to his partner.</p>
<p>The partner says, taking it, &ldquo;The B&amp;E hacker? This guy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very same. So, um&hellip; Yeah, Phil, let&rsquo;s not provide Mr. Dunbar with access to the laptops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can put &lsquo;em in the ambulance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; The Sergeant finishes writing down Sam&rsquo;s information and waves at Phil to pass back the ID. &ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Dunbar. Hope to see you again some day under better circumstances.&rdquo; Phil, shaking his head, goes and sits in the first squad car and starts detaching the swivel-mounted laptop.</p>
<p>Tabby&rsquo;s eyebrows raise as she looks at Sam. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a Hacker? Like in that 90s movie my older cousin used to always watch when I was little? What&rsquo;s your handle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not sure what hacker makes you think of, but I&rsquo;m an expert in security systems. Sure, I&rsquo;m in some online groups that attract people with&hellip;&ldquo;</p>
<p>As Sam is talking, the Sergeant starts to move—calmly enough not to make anyone jump but quickly enough to give Sam little time to react. He raises his arm with some kind of gadget in his hand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sergeant Attack: 2 Fight - 1 + 2 <em>Arm of the Law</em> = 3 (Good), -1 fate point
7:43
Sam Defend: 0 Fight - 2 = -2 (Terrible) <em>Fails</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;less than ideal motives, but that doesn&rsquo;t make me a crimin-AAAAOOOW.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam flinches, just a little, but otherwise is oblivious to what&rsquo;s happening. There&rsquo;s a click-snap sound, and Sam feels a sting in his arm. The Sergeant truly smiles for the first time. &ldquo;Heh. Be seeing you, Mr. Dunbar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! What the hell was that?&rdquo; Sam cries out, putting his hand up to his shoulder to feel this thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re GPS-enabled now!&rdquo; laughs Officer Phil, as he walks past them with the laptops in his arms.</p>
<p>Sam stuffs his passport back into his bag, and switches his shoulder strap over to his other, not-GPS-enabled shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I swear this has to be against my constitutional rights or something&hellip;&rdquo; he grumbles to himself, rubbing his shoulder.</p>
<p>Marcus gives a long, hard look to the Sergeant. &ldquo;<em>That</em> was uncalled for. Unless there&rsquo;s some emergency powers that you&rsquo;ve been vested with here, you&rsquo;ve no right to do that.&rdquo; Marcus turns to Sam to say, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see what we can do to get that out of you right now,&rdquo; and waves him to follow as Marcus moves to the ambulance.</p>
<p>Unphased by Marcus&rsquo; rebuke, the Sergeant says, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s tamper resistant, I wouldn&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo; He gives a half-hearted shrug. &ldquo;Same idea as those ankle-bracelets.&rdquo; He says to his partner, &ldquo;Ok, let&rsquo;s get this shuttle full up,&rdquo; and walks away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need to remove something from this man&rsquo;s arm,&rdquo; he announces to the paramedics as he hops into the back to get what he needs. &ldquo;Need me to numb it for you Sam or do you feel you can muscle through me getting that out of you?&rdquo; Marcus asks as he has gathered what appears to be some forceps, a scalpel, some sort of probe, and some other items.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure about this?&rdquo; Sam asks Marcus, hesitation in his voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s dark, we&rsquo;ve all been through a lot, I&rsquo;m sure I can get it removed in a decent medical facility. Plus, he said it&rsquo;s tamper resistant, whatever that means&hellip; Maybe we should get the hell out of here? I know I could really put some distance between myself and this damned runway from hell&hellip;&rdquo; Sam absent-mindedly touches his shoulder.</p>
<p>Tabby speaks up and adds momentum to Sam&rsquo;s suggestion, &ldquo;I guess if all these people are ready to be shuttled we might as well get off this runway now too. I call shotgun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal looks back at the ambulance to check on Mauve and her charge. She seems to have her situation handled, so he shrugs and walks with Tabby toward the cars. He lays a hand on the driver&rsquo;s door, then stops and unzips his bag. Pulling two whiskey nips and giving a little whistle, he makes eye contact with Sam and tosses them. &ldquo;Being mistreated by the man calls for a drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal then settles behind the wheel and starts texting his brother while the others arrive.</p>
<p>Sam&rsquo;s recognizes the tumbling Jack Daniels instantly and summons more than enough hand-eye coordination to acquire them both and slug one in the time it takes Marcus to say, &ldquo;entirely your call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, let&rsquo;s get the fuck out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marcus sets down the two or three pieces of equipment he had collected, then looks back at Sam. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind a sip of that if you don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; He trails off because the whiskey is nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry? Sip of what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um, nevermind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing that Tabby and Hal are in the nearer squad car, Marcus and Sam walk to the second.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for offering to help, Marcus. I appreciate the gesture. I&rsquo;ll get it taken out later. I mean, how bad can having a tracking device in your arm really be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>“I hear ya. I don’t care what you&rsquo;ve done in the past, you&rsquo;re helping now and that guy was an ass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you drive? I am at least going to google this thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the other car, Hal fiddles with radio in search of signal and stops on a station playing <em>Holiday in Cambodia</em>. In a raised, sarcastic voice, he says to the empty back seat, &ldquo;Alright you bozos keep your hands to yourself. No kissing.&rdquo; He adds more shyly, to Tabby, &ldquo;Is that something cops say? Do we still call them &lsquo;cops?&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
<p>Tabby grins and shrugs.</p>
<p>Hal turns a dial and directs the handset to the car&rsquo;s loudspeaker. &ldquo;Point the way, blokes,&rdquo; his voice booms.</p>
<p>Marcus pulls away from the crowd carefully, and Hal follows. It takes the party about 20 minutes to figure out how to actually get off the system of runways and to the right gate through the security fence, but when they do they&rsquo;re waved through. From there signs to I-40 are easy to follow.</p>
<p>As promised, Depty Kendrick starts awkwardly hailing them. Sam is the first to get a word in edgewise and let her know that they&rsquo;re all listening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, great. Something going right. Right. Okay. Okay, here, got it. Listen up. Our go-to for biological events is Dr. Kristine Griffin, at NIEHS, in the Research Triangle. Somebody take notes. 111 T. W. Alexander Drive, Durham, Neurotoxicology lab. She&rsquo;ll be there, at least she better be. She&rsquo;s got instructions in case of an emergency. Acquire, extract, return. Out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marcus says to Sam, &ldquo;Ask her what we should do if the doctor doesn&rsquo;t want to come with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if she won&rsquo;t come with us, umm&hellip;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over,&rdquo; Marcus supplies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what &lsquo;acquire&rsquo; means. You all need to be self-sufficient in this, that&rsquo;s the whole idea. I&rsquo;ve got to get off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, roger?&rdquo; Sam says, unsure.</p>
<p>Marcus nods and adds, &ldquo;Wilco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wilco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over and out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over and out.&rdquo; Sam hangs up the handset. &ldquo;So picky, this radio talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And computer language or whatever isn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop being right so much. It&rsquo;s annoying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Situation: <em>Cruisin&rsquo; in Cruisers</em>, <em>On a Mission From FEMA</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sam had been searching through some cyber security forums for information about the tracker in his arm. He hasn&rsquo;t found anything definitive, but some rumors that the thing&rsquo;s battery won&rsquo;t last more than a few days, and that it may be possible to fry it with the right kind of EM pulse.</p>
<p>He stops his browsing and notes the address of their desination when he hears it, then pulls it up on a map.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tabby, Hal, did you guys get that?&rdquo; Sam asks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we heard that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow us, I’ve got the route mapped out. Uhhh&hellip; Sam out and over&hellip; or, um, over and&hellip; whatever.&rdquo; He releases the talk switch, and says for Marcus&rsquo; benefit, &ldquo;Stupid radio babble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam immediately feels better when he notices a certain switch on the dashboard. He looks over to Marcus and grins as he switches on the police lights.</p>
<p>Marcus opens his mouth to say something, but then closes it again, and just keeps driving.</p>
<p>In the other car, Hal is both driving and entertaining himself by providing unnecessary narration over the car&rsquo;s loudspeaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;CHANGING LANES. ON YOUR LEFT.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stops and smiles to himself as he realizes that he recognizes the Sergeant: a minor league ball player who never got called up to majors but enjoyed a brief career as a baseball star in Japan. Gride, that was it, he thinks. Sergeant Jeromy Gride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;JUNCTION WITH 540 IN 3 MILES.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tabby doesn&rsquo;t react because she&rsquo;s absorbed in what she&rsquo;s just heard from Deputy Kendrick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, let me get this straight: We&rsquo;re supposed to <em>kidnap</em> this doctor if she doesn&rsquo;t come along with us? Hal, what the <em>fuck</em> is going on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal shrugs with honest humility. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure, but I think it might just be weird government speak. She probably didn&rsquo;t mean it exactly that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tabby snorts, &ldquo;Her answer to Marcus&rsquo; question was pretty plain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a kidnapping yet; we haven&rsquo;t plead our case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, I don&rsquo;t mean to overreact here, <em>but why aren&rsquo;t you overreacting to this</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal grins a little, embarassed, but instead of answering, gets back on the loudspeaker, &ldquo;WATCH YOUR DRIFT THERE, COWBOY.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me that!&rdquo; Hal lets Tabby take the handset from him unconstested. &ldquo;Umm, Car 2&hellip; or whatever&hellip; I need to know: we not seriously doing this, right? Did I miss something about laws and ethics? &lsquo;Aquire&rsquo; her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam here. We&rsquo;re only picking her up, why wouldn&rsquo;t she want to come? She apparently signed up for this, what with her having &lsquo;instructions in case of emergency&rsquo; and all&hellip; Over. And, um&hellip; It&rsquo;s the middle of the night, and we&rsquo;re expecting her to be at her lab? Over again. Oh, um this was Sam again. Over-over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal makes a quizzical expression in passing as a reaction to the preposition stew. &ldquo;He makes a good point,&rdquo; he says to Tabby, &ldquo;but will she even be there? Maybe a good chance just by virtue of it being a lifestyle job. But if she is not how do we find her? Also, what credential are we going to present to convince her of the legitimacy of our errand?&rdquo; Tabby nods and relays these questions to the other car.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;Car 2&rdquo; Marcus gestures for Sam to pass back the handset. &ldquo;If she&rsquo;s not there,&rdquo; he says into the radio, &ldquo;then Sam can certainly find her address on the company intranet, and that would be our next stop. That being said, I feel our first stop should be a Wal-Mart. We need more gear than just what we were able to grab on our way off the airplane that crashed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marcus pauses for a moment clicks the talk switch again. &ldquo;Car 1, we clearly still don’t have all the information. I completely understand that this is all off-putting. I need coffee and I think we all need more gear than we have right now. And a discussion of our next step couldn&rsquo;t hurt. Keep following us. Over.&rdquo; Marcus sets the handset in its cradle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam, see if you can’t find a Wal-Mart or it’s equivalent nearby off the highway. Thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tabby and I agree. See if you can find one that is also near a Home Depot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam says, &ldquo;It’s the middle of the night, everything is closed,&rdquo; as he stabs and swipes at his tablet. &ldquo;Or not. There&rsquo;s a Walmart in Clegg&hellip; and it&rsquo;s open 24/7. Get onto the 540 West coming up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam here, Car 2. Theres a Walmart off 540 that&rsquo;s open. We’re heading there now. I’m all for grabbing some dry clothes but what do you guys need? Kidnapping supplies? Sam out. Errrrr, over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re Car 1, and <em>your</em> name is Sam,&rdquo; Hal responds, &ldquo;Over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Dammit, I give up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam starts searching the Internet for information about Dr. Kristine Griffin as they make their way to the Wal-Mart, and finds out she runs the Neurotoxicology Group at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. There are plenty of hits, but they&rsquo;re all very esoteric academic proceedings, citations, abstracts, and the like. Sam adds the search term &ldquo;virus&rdquo; and again finds plenty of hits, but doesn&rsquo;t understand them.</p>
<p>The party arrives at the Wal-Mart in short order and pulls into its expansive parking lot. Marcus parks quickly, choosing a distant, darker, empty portion of the lot. Hal parks next to him.</p>
<p>Tabby gets out and then makes room for Marcus who is right beside her. She says, &ldquo;Looks like they&rsquo;ve got a McDonald&rsquo;s in there. I think we should get coffees and sit and make a l—&rdquo; She stops and looks down as something clatters to the pavement at her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I could use one. Sounds good.&rdquo; Before he can ask what Tabby&rsquo;s looking at, two vehicles rattling with bass and blazing with after-market headlights swoop by, distracting him. When they pass, Marcus looks left and right to see if Sam and Hal are on board with the plan, but then the rear of the two vehicles stops, sounds its horn for a second, and reverses quickly. The one in front also stops, and a second later the driver gets the idea and also reverses.</p>
<p>A cocky-sounding male leaning out the high passenger side window of a 4x4 on large tires says, &ldquo;You motherfuckers ain&rsquo;t no cops.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="character"><p>? (Some Asshole in a Truck)</p>
<p><em>Spoiling for a Fight</em>, <em>Rolling Deep</em></p></div>

<p>Sam mumbles to himself: &ldquo;Not again&hellip; I need a bloody drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tabby stands back up from picking up the fallen object. No sees because they&rsquo;re all looking at the newcomers, but her hand tightens reflexively around her new acquisition: a police baton.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a little taken aback by what is clearly impolite behavior from strangers and remains silent as she studies the men in the truck from the rear. The newfound baton in her hand subconsciously gives her a sense of security and ease, but with everything else she&rsquo;s been through today it is an effort not to let her emotions boil over. She impulsively glances to Marcus assuming that he will attempt to diffuse the situation, but she&rsquo;s on alert.</p>
<p>Hal’s first impulse is to say something ill-advised into the loudspeaker. He represses the urge with a grimace, but is at a loss at how to respond, since pretending to not hear does not seem an option.</p>
<p>The Head Asshole opens the passenger side truck door and steps down. He&rsquo;s got a leather vest on with no shirt beneath, with emblems and patches on it. Two men also get out of the car in front, an Escalade, and walk back to the truck. They&rsquo;re also wearing black leather vests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&rsquo;d&rsquo;ya figure, Kay?&rdquo; says one of the men from the Escalade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me we&rsquo;ve got outlaws on our hands.&rdquo; He leans back toward the truck, kocking on the window, and says, &ldquo;Hey, you fuckers get out here.&rdquo; Addressing the party, Kay says, &ldquo;You kiddies all go on now, we&rsquo;ll make sure these rides you stole get into the right hands. Heh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he finished talking, a total of four other men have joined him. They&rsquo;re generally mean looking, and two are fairly overweight.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Asshole Overcome: 2 Provoke + 0 roll + 2 <em>Rolling Deep</em> = 4 (Great), -1 fate point</p>
<p>Hal Defend: 4 Will - 2 roll = 2 (Fair) <em>Fails</em></p>

<p>Marcus employs stunt <em>Shield of Reason</em>. Defend: 4 Lore + 3 roll = 7 (Epic) <em>Succeeds With Style</em> gains boost <em>Ice Cold</em></p>
<p>Sam Defend: 1 Will + 1 roll = 2 (Fair) <em>Fails</em></p>
<p>Hal and Sam are intimidated and decide they don&rsquo;t to mess with these guys. Marcus is more than unphased. Tabby is only shaken, but grants the Asshole a boost: <em>Easy Targets</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Kay was it?&rdquo; Marc asks as he very visibly bounces the keys in his hands few times then tosses them on the drivers seat of the squad, &ldquo;all yours. I&rsquo;ve no beef with you boys. I&rsquo;m heading to that McDonalds for some coffee.&rdquo; Turning to the others as he starts to walk towards the McDonalds, &ldquo;you three coming with?&rdquo; His manner is tired, dismissive of the gang by the truck, and way above it all. Kay and those around him unconsciously shift their bodies to make way for him in deference; they won&rsquo;t be giving Marcus any more shit.</p>
<p>Sam was busy putting his tablet back in his bag and was just opening his door when the men got out of the trucks. Before getting out, he leans back in and switches on the mic. &ldquo;Hello, Deputy Kendrick? Sam here. I think we&rsquo;re gonna need backup at the Walmart in Clegg, off 540. Make it quick or you might be missing 2 squad cards.&rdquo; He leaves the mic on and gets out of the car with his bag, walking behind Marcus.</p>
<p>Hal avoids eye contact but starts getting out of the car as if to follow Marcus and Sam.</p>
<p>Tabby is visibly confused by Marcus&rsquo;s response. &ldquo;Yeah but&hellip; how will we&hellip;&rdquo; she says as Marcus walks off. Tabby shakes it off and addresses Kay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I appreciate your sense of honor and civic loyalty, sir, but we&rsquo;re on official government business and we have the authority to use these vehicles.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tabby Overcome: 1 Rapport + 1 roll + 2 <em>On A Mission From FEMA</em> = 4 (Great) <em>Succeeds</em> -1 fate point</p>

<p>Kay and his gang believe Tabby that the party has official sanction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck you are,&rdquo; says one of the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bullshit,&rdquo; says Kay, at the same moment, but his face shows that he&rsquo;s unsure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t matter none, Kay. You know nobody be showin&rsquo; up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam stops walking and turns back, surprised to see that Tabby has these guys at least partially convinced.</p>
<p>“Come along Tabby,” Marcus yells as he continues walking, “the feds will clean up these guys in the morning. We’ve things to do and there’s nothing back there we need.”</p>
<p>Hal does a quadruple take between Tabby and Marcus then turns purple with silent fury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get checked for a concussion after the plane crash Marcus?&rdquo; Tabby yells back in confusion, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got no business in that McDonald&rsquo;s other than <em>your</em> coffee and we absolutely completely do need these cars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal kicks his keys under the car, puts on his pack, and starts to walk toward the road, giving every impression of heading for the hills. Suddenly he stops, turns back, on hands and knees gets the car keys back, gets in, and blasts over the loud speaker, &ldquo;Marcus, can you grab me a 16 ounce coffee and an apple pie thanks.&rdquo; Then he flicks on the lights and the siren. Everyone winces a bit at the harsh light and noise.</p>
<p>Marcus pauses without turning around, shakes his head a little, but keeps walking.</p>
<p>When Kay&rsquo;s gang see this, they subtly shift posture forward, toward the remaining party of three.</p>
<p>&ldquo;FEMA or the fairy fucking godmother, they ain&rsquo;t helpin&rsquo; you all.&rdquo; Kay starts forward, shoulders tight and hands at waist level.</p>
<p>Sam speaks up, &ldquo;God dammit. Our fucking plane just crashed!&rdquo; This is enough to make everyone stop and look at him. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some kind of god-forsaken virus going around and for some reason we weren&rsquo;t affected. The whole god-damned airport&rsquo;s been quarantined. I&rsquo;d stay the fuck away if I were you!&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sam Overcome: 4 Deceive + 0 roll = 4 (Great) <em>Succeeds</em></p>
<p>Kay passive Defend: 0 Empathy = 0 (Mediocre) <em>Fails</em></p>
<p>Kay and his gang are convinced that the party is infected with something dangerous.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hal sees this having an effect on the interlopers and gets with the tactic. In a dramatically exasperated tone—still over the loud speaker—he says, “Kay, hhhhhuuuuhhh you would not believe the day we have had.”</p>
<p>Everyone in Kay&rsquo;s gang rolls back on their heels and puts their palms forward. &ldquo;You all sick with something? Aw hell, no,&rdquo; says one of the fat ones.</p>
<p>Hal sneezes loudly directly into loud speaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sweet as it&rsquo;d be to roll in them cruisers, I don&rsquo;t need no virus. Let&rsquo;s get.&rdquo; The fat man adds, and the men from the Escalade nod and start walk off, to Kay&rsquo;s frustration.</p>
<p>Hal get his phone out and starts shooting pictures. No one see him because they&rsquo;re blinded by the cruiser&rsquo;s flashing lights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck!&rdquo; Kay adds, eloquently. &ldquo;You all some weak shit,&rdquo; he says to his crew. &ldquo;And y&rsquo;all just&hellip; strange. Whatever. Fuck it.&rdquo; They all get back in their truck and thump off.</p>
<p>Hal turns off the whooping siren and Sam and Tabby visibly relax.</p>
<p>Sam reaches back into the car and speaks into the radio mic, &ldquo;Sam here, never mind the backup, we&rsquo;re fine. Over.&rdquo; He grabs the keys in the driver seat and locks the doors.</p>
<p>Sam asks Tabby and Hal, &ldquo;You guys alright?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tabby ungrits her teeth, and relaxes what had been a white-knuckle grip on the police baton. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m good,&rdquo; she scoffs at the retreating gang. &ldquo;With the day I&rsquo;ve had&hellip; Well, it was a bad night to be a bully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three look over in Marcus&rsquo; direction and see him stopped not far away, watching the departure of the gang. Not out of reach should something really have gone down, but still not at conversational distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck, I could use that coffee now,&rdquo; Tabby says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s all go get some coffee, food and some time to think a little.&rdquo; Sam starts walking towards the McDonalds-Walmart. Hal locks up his car and he and Tabby follow, with Hal commenting, calmly but with unguarded annoyance in his voice, “what’s <em>his</em> deal?”</p>
<p>Sam, replies, &ldquo;Eh, tough night. I wouldn&rsquo;t judge anyone after everything that&rsquo;s happened.&rdquo; As they approach Marcus, Sam says to him, &ldquo;Marcus, were you really gonna let &lsquo;em pick a fight with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marcus shrugs, &ldquo;I just really didn&rsquo;t expect the situation to require any violence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal opens his mouth to speak a few times but stops himself each time. Finally he takes a breath and says, “That could have gone a hell of a lot worse. Not sure what you had in mind there, but next time, you mind including us in your grand designs?”</p>
<p>&ldquo;My &lsquo;grand design&rsquo; was to get away from those shits, and I tried to say as much. I get that you feel like I was doing something risky, but from my perspective I was trying to get us all <em>out</em> of danger. Jesus, I&rsquo;m not even sure what we&rsquo;re all <em>doing</em> here&hellip; but look, you can trust that I&rsquo;m going to worry more about keeping people safe than a couple of cars. Even if we don&rsquo;t agree, you should know that&rsquo;s where my priorities are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The group walks into the store without further discussion, all deciding words would be better spoken with less adrenaline and more caffeine.</p>

            

            <div id="walmart" class="bookmark"></div>

            <h2>WalMart</h2>
<div class="situation"><p><em>It&rsquo;s a WalMart</em>, <em>Quiet</em></p></div>

<p>Once they get through the main door, Sam says &ldquo;Well, grab me large coffee and a big mac? I&rsquo;ll be there in a second.&rdquo; He turns down an aisle and vanishes into the larger Walmart.</p>
<p>Hal indulges in coffee and a chicken sandwich, gets Sam&rsquo;s order and an apple pie for later. Tammy orders two happy meals and also a coffee. She sweet-talks the kid behind the counter into giving her six creams. Marcus just orders a coffee.</p>
<p>Hal is the last to scoop up his orders and joins the reluctant gang. He sighs and asks them, &ldquo;What d&rsquo;you guys think about all this? Do we think we need to prepare for scarcity and—&rdquo; Marcus and Tabby simultaneously frown and shush him. Hal turns red and lowers his voice. &ldquo;—and infrastructure failure or just a road trip? Do we need water, fuel, days worth of food?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marcus and Tabby look down at their coffees and clearly don&rsquo;t want to talk just yet. Hal starts thumbing a shopping list into his phone: batteries of all kinds including two car batteries; an extra set of jumper cables; a fuel canister. He types reluctantly then erases &ldquo;shotgun&rdquo; and replaces with &ldquo;crowbar.&rdquo; Speaker wire; sundry items from the hardware section; bottle(s) Johnny Walker Black; Little Debby oatmeal creek pies.</p>
<p>Sam finds the group at the table and sits down next to Hal. He&rsquo;s wearing some new clothes: dark jeans, a red long-sleeve t-shirt and a generic grey sweatshirt. He grabs the coffee that no one seems to have touched yet, &ldquo;This one for me?&rdquo; The others nod.</p>
<p>He pops off the lid and discreetly pulls a small bottle of Bailey&rsquo;s out of his sweatshirt pocket. &ldquo;Anyone want some?&rdquo; he asks as he pours some into his coffee, &ldquo;I hear it works wonders for calming your nerves after a plane crash!&rdquo; Sam isn&rsquo;t put out when no one grins or otherwise reacts to his sarcasm.</p>
<p>Sam leans over and looks at Hal&rsquo;s phone. &ldquo;A crowbar? A fuel canister? What do you think we&rsquo;ve gotten ourselves into? I thought we were just going to pick up this scientist lady and bring her to wherever Kendricks wants her to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wellll I mean I don&rsquo;t know that things are about to become all Mad Max or anything, but I don&rsquo;t know that they&rsquo;re not, either… anybody know where we can get our hands on some krugerrands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a krugerrand?&rdquo; Marcus asks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In seriousness, do you think we need to prepare for and be equipped to deal in, you know,&rdquo; Hal looks around, puts hand down on table out of view of other patrons and makes a finger gun, then finishes in hushed voice, &ldquo;deadly force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam replies, &ldquo;Jesus, I hope not… One close encounter with death per night is more than enough for me. Anyway, we&rsquo;re basically just playing Uber at this point it seems. I mean, I&rsquo;m all for being prepared but… This doesn&rsquo;t seem like that kind of crisis. Unless you think,&rdquo; Sam lowers his voice, &ldquo;it was a terrorist attack or something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before anyone can answer, someone announces through the PA system, &ldquo;We apologize for the inconvenience, shoppers, but we will be closing in 15 minutes. Please bring your items to checkout. Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tabby says, &ldquo;Sam, I thought you said this was a 24-hour place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did. It is. I mean, it&rsquo;s supposed to be?&rdquo; Sam takes a bite out of his BigMac and pulls out his phone as he&rsquo;s chewing. &ldquo;It says right here… open 24/7.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He takes another bite and starts checking Google, Twitter and other relevant online resources for anything related to the plane crash, the rash or that could explain the Walmart closing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone have a theory as to what the heck is going on? Is closing down a Walmart a standard procedure in times of crisis? You learn about this stuff as an EMT Marcus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not many Walmart&rsquo;s in the boroughs, but it does feel like it might be related. Hal, you might not be wholly wrong in stocking up on some of that stuff. I don&rsquo;t know for sure anymore than anyone else does. Sam, people get scared when they don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re ‘supposed&rsquo; to be doing—and when they&rsquo;re scared, they have a tendency to get violent. I think we should be prepared for that. Tabby, from how you were standing up to Kay, I get the feeling that you and violence are somewhat acquainted. So, with that being said—we have 15 minutes. Everyone should grab what they think they might need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal flashes his credit card and volunteers, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got about $7,200 unused balance on this one so let&rsquo;s max it out. I&rsquo;ll run through hardware and take requests. If somebody can grab some extra food and water for me and maybe a bottle of whiskey if you see it.&rdquo; Hal nervously eats his apple pie—which suddenly feels like a burden—in three big bites, barely taking time to taste it. He looks a little green when he&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>Marcus heads off without making any requests, picking up classic emergency supplies: backpack, first aid, water, knife, flashlight, and dried food.</p>
<p>Taby and Hal confer, then grab carts and hurry through the store in opposite directions. Hal winds up in the sporting goods section first and a 34&rdquo; softball bat rings loudly in his cart, then he loads up on anything that could fix a car or send a signal, texting with Marcus and Tabby as he goes.</p>
<p>Sam leisurely finishes eating his BigMac, picks up a few things in the electronics section and then grabs a party-sized bag of Chex Mix before heading to self-checkout. He heads outside and waits for the others as he sips his coffee, adding a little extra Bailey&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Tabby is the second to the checkout with a cart full of bottled water, socks, blankets, and paperback novels. Only one aisle is staffed, by a man wearing a shirt and tie with no name tag instead of a WalMart vest. Tabby goes right up and makes conversation while unloading her cart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; the man sighs, &ldquo;welcome to WalMart.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="character"><p>Store Manager</p>
<p><em>Why Must I Do Everything Myself</em></p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Hey there! Why&rsquo;re you guys closing?&rdquo; A puffy plastic package of women&rsquo;s ankle athletic socks hit the conveyor belt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh we&rsquo;re just having some trouble with staffing, scheduling all the shifts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad. Must be pretty bad if the store manager,&rdquo; Tabby glaces up and down the empty checkout lanes, &ldquo;is the only one working checkout. You must have better things to do!&rdquo; Tabby squats and wrangles a 48 pack of Ice Mountain out of the bottom of the cart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can say that again. Yeah, it&rsquo;s pretty bad…&rdquo; the man stops himself from saying more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tabby Overcome: 1 Rapport + 0 roll = 1 (Average) <em>Ties</em>

<p>The manager feels at ease enough to vent, but isn&rsquo;t friendly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;At my coffee shop back in New York, it seems like I spend half my time just chasing after people who miss or move their shift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mmm hmm,&rdquo; the Manager says, scanning a Hulk fleece throw. &ldquo;Y&rsquo;know, it&rsquo;s the strangest thing tonight, though. Not only did a bunch of my night shift not come in, but the ones who were here called me down to reset their points of sale maybe a dozen times, and then left early.&rdquo; The scanner beeps in a chunky Dan Brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so strange!&rdquo; Tabby agrees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be writing emails all night explaining this to corporate, but I can&rsquo;t keep the store open if there&rsquo;s no one here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal and Marcus roll up with all their stuff. The Manager waves them forward as Tabby swipes her card. She relates his story to Hal and Marcus. When it comes time for Marcus to pay, the transaction won&rsquo;t go through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try mine,&rdquo; Hal says, waving his card. Marcus shrugs and takes it. It doesn&rsquo;t work either.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; the Manager sighs, &ldquo;might be the reader. Mind if I try it over here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; Hal says.</p>
<p>The Manager walks over to the next register and swipes a card from his pocket. He rapidly hits a series of buttons, then turns to the card reader and swipes Hal&rsquo;s credit card. &ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still nothing?&rdquo; Tabby asks.</p>
<p>The Manager doesn&rsquo;t answer but goes to a third register and does the same thing. &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t make any sense,&rdquo; he says, frowning, putting both hands on the counter and leaning in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, shit,&rdquo; Hal says, suddenly groping for his phone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asks Marcus, reacting to Hal&rsquo;s surprise and turning around.</p>
<p>Hal doesn&rsquo;t answer but just stares at his phone&rsquo;s total lack of cell signal. After a second he just holds up the phone for Marcus to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo; Marcus steps toward Hal and reaches out for the phone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No bars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ok, so we&rsquo;re in a dead zone, what do you—&rdquo; Tabby says, interrupted by Sam awkwardly running in from the entry with heavy plastic shopping bags, almost dropping a huge, open bag of snack mix he had clearly been eating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guys! I was on Twitter and suddenly lost my signal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Manager looks up from the card reader he had been poking at. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have to get some people in here to look at these. I&rsquo;m sorry folks, but we&rsquo;ll have to close now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone looks at Marcus&rsquo; and Hal&rsquo;s full carts, and then back at the Manager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Umm, hang on,&rdquo; Hal says, &ldquo;we might have enough cash to cover this. Would mind waiting just a minute?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The manager nods, and pulls out his own phone, frowning and tapping at it in frustration.</p>
<p>Marcus waves Sam over and the group confers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the manager say anything about why a 24/7 Walmart was closing?&rdquo; Sam asks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Credit card billing appears to be not working, which could be related to the lack of bars on our cell phones. But besides that, no one showed up to cover their shifts. The issue at hand, whatever it is, appears to be expanding its impact. I wasn&rsquo;t confident that the airport was ground zero to begin with and now, even less so. Let&rsquo;s get all this stuff in the cars and get this scientist,&rdquo; turning to Sam, &ldquo;do we have an address still and a map to get there or did we lose that when we lost cell coverage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My satellite card is back in the car, but if the Internet is still there, it will work&hellip; oh shit, guys, the Internet is still there, right?&rdquo; Sam grabs another handful of snack mix.</p>
<p>Hal ignores Sam&rsquo;s question but digs in his pockets for his wallet. A few seconds later he has a thick fold of bills that he splits with Marcus. Newly confident that he will be able to purchase his goods, he nervously tears into one of the oatmeal cream pies in his cart. He puts it down after one bite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, uh, excuse me, sir,&rdquo; Hal asks the Manager, &ldquo;is it just the credit card machines that aren&rsquo;t working? Do your, uh,&rdquo; he pauses to pull the term he recently heard from his memory, &ldquo;points of sale need the Internet?&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hal Create an Advantage: 1 Rapport - 1 roll = 0 (Mediocre) <em>Fails</em></p>
<p>Manager Passive Opposition: 1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The manager slides his phone into his front shirt pocket. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not an expert at these things, they&rsquo;re just supposed to work. I&rsquo;d love to get you folks all taken care of, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal nods, getting the message that the guy is tired and not ready to shoot the breeze. He looks around, trying to take in how other people might be reacting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hal Create an Advantage: 3 Notice + 2 roll = 5 (Superb) <em>Succeeds with Style</em> Situation passive opposion: 2, Hal creates aspect <em>Still With It</em> &#9744; &#9744;</p>
<p>Hal notices that the Store Manager is fluent and capable with his machines (despite their various malfunctions), unlike everyone else he&rsquo;s met since the plane crashed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hal and Marcus check out and pay with Hal&rsquo;s cash, while Tabby and Sam bag everything. Hal plucks a pen from his pocket and scribbles his name and number on the receipt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guys,&rdquo; he says, looking around, &ldquo;go with me for a second here, add your details to this receipt.&rdquo; He holds the paper and pen out to Marcus. Marcus squints a little, but does as Hal asks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hal Overcome: 1 Rapport + 1 roll + 2 <em>Still With It</em> &#9745; &#9744; = 4 (Great) <em>Succeeds</em></p>
<p>Manager passive opposition: 2</p>
<p>The Manager is gratified someone has recognized his efforts and is willing to hear out Hal&rsquo;s unusual request.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s been a shit day,&rdquo; Hal says, and the Manager grunts in affirmation, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;re, uhh, we&rsquo;re really grateful you were here to deal with it all and to help us out. If you need something&hellip;&rdquo; Tabby finishes scribbling on the receipt and hands it back to Hal, who hands it to the Manager, &ldquo;consider getting in touch. You might also reach us if you contact the airport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Manager passively accepts the receipt with an incredulous expression. &ldquo;Ummmmm&hellip;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I know, I sound crazy. Just, uh, just hang on to that, what can it hurt, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, so,&rdquo; the Manager cracks a forced smile and puts the receipt in his pocket, &ldquo;you folks have a good night!&rdquo; He reaches over and turns off the checkout lane&rsquo;s light.</p>
<p>As the group walks out the door, Sam throws his empty McDonalds cup in the trash. &ldquo;Um, Hal, what was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The guy wasn&rsquo;t confused, not with his register, not with phone. Everyone else he said couldn&rsquo;t work their checkout, but he was doing fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marcus&rsquo;s eyebrows go up, &ldquo;Ah! I&rsquo;ll bet he doesn&rsquo;t have a rash either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were only four of us on that whole plane. I don&rsquo;t know how many people like him we&rsquo;re going to run into. I figured it would be good to at least try to, I don&rsquo;t know, make contact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good thinking,&rdquo; Sam said, &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m more worried about Dr. Griffin. I don&rsquo;t know what these <em>instructions in case of an emergency</em> were, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem like they included anyone answering at the lab, or the doctor&rsquo;s cell. I tried everything, no answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tabby says, &ldquo;Could be anything, like maybe she&rsquo;s just not picking up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, let&rsquo;s just get there,&rdquo; Hal says. &ldquo;What channel are we on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same one,&rdquo; Marcus says, &ldquo;Sam, why don&rsquo;t you ride with Hal and show him where to go. I&rsquo;ll follow with Tabby.&rdquo; Sam and Hal peel off to their car.</p>
<p>As they toss things into the trunk, Marcus asks Tabby, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;d like to know more about your intentions with that stick of yours and how familiar you are with using it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This?&rdquo; Tabby looks down at her waistband where she had tucked the baton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; as Marcus heaves in another three gallon water container, &ldquo;that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No experience, really. I guess it just reminds me of one of the pieces of my kit. Sure feels better than nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your kit?&rdquo; Raises one eyebrow quizzically. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heh, yeah.&rdquo; Tabby tosses a backpack-sized first-aid-and-survival-kit. &ldquo;I, uh, make things. My current favorite is tamper with a brass knuckle grip. This is a little like my sharpened portafilter; not quite as fun, obviously. Left it all back at my place though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make things. Like, deadly weapons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of cafe paraphenalia, yup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, um,&rdquo; Marcus stops loading for a second, &ldquo;are you deadly with these deadly weapons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hah, what?&rdquo; Tabby laughs, but sees that Marcus is serious. &ldquo;I mean, no one&rsquo;s died yet! Lester, my training dummy, is mostly still in one piece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mostly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like you&rsquo;ve never had a bad day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Touché.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marcus and Tabby slam the truck closed, let the cart sit in the adjacent parking spot, get in the car, and pull out onto the road behind Sam and Hal.</p>
<p>In Sam and Hal&rsquo;s car, Sam asks, &ldquo;Hal, before the cell signal gave out, I saw the &lsquo;blurry&rsquo; hashtag was trending on Twitter&hellip; You ever heard of that before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal glances at other vehicle in the rearview. &ldquo;&hellip;&lsquo;blurry&rsquo;?? Mmmnot ringing a bell. What context, what are people tweeting about? Like, eyesight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no idea, all I saw was some girl tweeting that her&hellip;&rdquo; Sam uses air-quotes &ldquo;nerd boyfriend can&rsquo;t even rn.&rdquo; Sam puts his bag of Party Mix at his feet and pulls out his tablet to see if the satellite connection still works.</p>
<p>Sam grabs the radio and imitates the sound as it connects, &ldquo;<em>Pshchrtt</em> Sam here, good news folks: satellite internet still works! It&rsquo;s a lot slower than our normal 8g internet, but at least they don&rsquo;t throttle Netflix! We should be there in 10 minutes flat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam grabs a handful of Party Mix and stuffs it in his mouth, before realizing something. He clicks the radio back on. &ldquo;<em>munch munch</em> Over <em>cough munch</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they drive towards the research lab, Sam heads back to Twitter and other news sources to try and figure what the hell is going on.</p>
<p>Hal glances over at Sam&rsquo;s travel rig. &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t look like something you find at Frye&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope, definitely not available at retail! It&rsquo;s from&hellip; well, I guess you could call it &lsquo;military surplus&rsquo;? But it&rsquo;s running a heavily customized OS and software package I put together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Customized for what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mostly me getting things done fast. For instance, I&rsquo;m done poking idly at Twitter. I&rsquo;m going to write an AI bot that runs a search for us, looking for interesting news stories. I&rsquo;m also interested, since you pointed out there aren&rsquo;t many people like us without the rash, how much general Internet traffic has changed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yup, just shut up for a minute so I can think.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sam Overcome: 3 Software + 0 roll = 3 (Good) <em>Ties</em> passive opposition of 3</p>
<p>Sam&rsquo;s AI bot is written and set to work in short order, and he configures it correctly to do the job he&rsquo;s interested in, but at a small cost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Ok, go go gadget search bot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice! So what&rsquo;s it say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dude, it&rsquo;s searching, like, the entire Internet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. So you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s not done yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pass the snack mix.&rdquo;</p>
