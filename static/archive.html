            <h2>Backstory</h2>
<p>In the five years since 2017, two nations have been occupied and one has drowned beneath the rising seas, the South China Sea belongs to the PRC, AI has soaked deeper into the fabric of the first world, little has changed for the poor, and humans have returned to the moon.</p>
<p>The Trump administration never got off the ground geopolitically. After it became clear the Commander in Chief could neither strategize effectively nor accept advice from those who could, Russia and China made decisive moves, anticipating a weak response from the World&rsquo;s Policeman. Russia has annexed Georgia and Estonia, and China has declared that it would start enforcing it&rsquo;s &ldquo;border&rdquo; in the South China Sea and moved in the oil rigs. In both cases US forces pulled back without incident.</p>
<p>The island nation of Tuvalu, without the wealth or credit to reinforce its infrastructure and facing imminent sea level rise that would displace half its population, has instructed all of its citizens to evacuate, becoming a stateless nation.</p>
<p>Gary Herbert, former governor of Utah, got ahold of the infamous Russian Hotel Tapes and intimidated the incumbent into not running in 2020. He was elected over his Democratic challenger on a values-and-fiscal-responsibility platform. The GOP&rsquo;s embrace of the nationalist right has become less overt but is still earning them votes.</p>
<p>Research into and commercialization of machine learning algorithms has advanced rapidly and digital services in general are significantly better as a result. AI embedded in networks and operating systems make devices and connections more responsive by learning and predicting user&rsquo;s actions. Many service jobs, like retail, have been replaced by the personable offspring of Siri and Alexa. Many sectors of the economy are notably more efficient because their logistics are being optimized by AI. Self-driving cars are common on the roads and consensus is spreading that they save lives on average.</p>
<p>The trend toward income inequality has continued, but the trickle of improvements in everyday conveniences has prevented any serious unrest from gathering.</p>
<p>Countries outside the G20 have shown no remarkable changes in prosperity, although humanitarian efforts to increase quality of life for the very poor have continued. The WHO has begun to project a peak in the sub-Saharan AIDS crisis; several gambits to reduce malaria-carrying mosquito populations have gone well. But most of the world&rsquo;s people still live chaotic, improverished lives.</p>
<p>SpaceX backed off its timeline to land its crewed spacecraft on Mars several times, but has landed on the moon with a crew of four astronauts. The highly educated and loyal fans of space flight celebrated but the US populace in general are underwhelmed. Conspiracy theorists allow the SpaceX landing was real but maintain the Apollo landings were still fake. Despite this, commerical rocketry has demonstrated there&rsquo;s money to be made and several other companies are refining low cost-to-orbit rockets.</p>
<p>The moon landing highlighted, by its lack of dramatic impact on the public&rsquo;s imagination, a growing ennui in the US. Progressives are increasingly intimidated by the resilience of reactionary ideas, average people are beginning to feel the glow fading from American Exceptionalism in the wake of Russia&rsquo;s and China&rsquo;s advances, daily life is rich with entertainment but thin with real or gainful work.</p>
