<h2 id="marcus-cain">Marcus Cain: Background</h2>
<p>
  Marcus was 19 and living in Brooklyn during September 11th. He joined the Navy 3 days later in hopes of serving as a corpsman tied to a Marine unit. He did just that until he retired from active service in late 2010. He came home to NY and, after obtaining the needed licenses and certifications and passing the fireman test (all of which were easy for him after nearly a decade in the Navy serving with Marines), he started his job in a firehouse in the Bronx. Given his locale for his job, he's kept up on his shooting skills, kept in shape, and kept his reflexes tight.
</p>
<p>
  He loves his job. He's good at his job. Though he has 3 commendations from FDNY in 7 years and several more from his time in the military, he can't shake the feeling that he's should be better than this - he should save more, do more, BE more. This has kept him in and out of relationships with girlfriends and only holding onto a select group of close friends.
</p>
<p>
  Marcus has been saving up and recently finished majoring in Biological Science at NYU. He has been offered preliminary acceptance to a number of nursing schools and was at Duke University for an in person tour and interview. He also met with the contact he'd been speaking with over the phone regarding a new job with the City of Raleigh Fire Department. Hoping to start school and a new job in the fall, Marcus heads back to Raleigh-Durham International with his hopes for his future high.

<h2 id="sam-dunbar">Sam Dunbar: Background</h2>
<p>
  After graduating from college with a Computer Science degree specialized in security systems, enetered the job market full of ambition. He quickly realized that working as a security consultant for larger companies was not everything he hoped it would be. All these companies had abysmally poor security, yet making any small improvement required months of bureaucracy and heaven forbid it would actually cost something to implement.
</p>
<p>
  Sam quit after only a few months and eventually found work with some more unsavory type&mdash;instead of improving security, he was compromising it. His <em>modus operandi</em> was always the same: he&rsquo;d be nowhere near the targetted business on the night of the heist. He did all his prep work ahead of time and would disable security systems remotely.
</p>
<h3>First Adventure</h3>
<p>
  The &ldquo;Eta Council&rdquo; is the US branch of an international crime organization specializing in the acquisition of high-end pieces of art for rich individuals with exquisite tastes.
</p>
<p>
  Sam initially worked for them on a heist at the Philadelphia Museum of Art when it was hosting a temporary exhibit with a particularly valuable Rembrandt. He suspected they weren't going to pay his (admittedly high) fee, so he set about trying to find something to black mail them with. He embed a virus in the encrypted email he sent them alongside the exact time the museum's security system would go offline. And oh boy did he get what he needed. As soon as they opened that email, his program started collecting every piece of data it could get access to.
</p>
<p>
 The heist went <em>exactly</em> as he had planned: a pizza was delivered to the front desk, distracting the guards at the exact moment the security systems went offline. A few minutes later and the Rembrandt was gone.
</p>
<p>
  A few days later, Sam was halfway across the country and, as he suspected, had not yet been paid. He sure got his money fast after calling his contact's home number and leaving a message with their wife though.

<h2 id="tabby-charmichael">"Tabby" Tabitha Charmichael: Background</h2>
<p>
  Tabby grew up in rural North Carolina working in the family business, which
  was part horse ranch and part welding/blacksmith. She learned the trade,
  often using welding to pursue artistic avenues instead of practical ones.
</p>
<p>
  When it came time for her to head off to school she chose one in NYC, much to
  her family&rsquo;s chagrin. Studying engineering, she took a part time job in a
  coffee shop. Before her first year of college was over she had lost interest
  in school, and dropped out to work full-time in an industry that promised
  social interaction, art and culture, and a way to use her crafting skills and
  attention to detail in a way that welding never allowed her to: to make other
  people smile. Being a barista was a natural fit, and she never looked back.
</p>
<p>
  Her mother worried constantly about her safety in the big city, and so at her
  urging Tabby took self-defense classes. She excelled, but it was the
  spiritual side that really hooked her. This led to many other classes: yoga,
  tai chi, spinning. She wrapped this all into a philosophy of connecting her
  body and spirit with that of her customers, and creating something of value.
</p>
<p>
  Her parents still wanted Tabby to finish school, or else come home and work
  an &ldquo;honest&rdquo; trade. This left a rift between them. Tabby was going
  to find her own way; indeed she already had. Then she got the news. There had
  been an accident. It was time for her to return to NC. The family business
  was hers now, and she was all alone.
</p>
<p>
  Many of her art pieces are macabre coffeeshop equipment: a tamper with a
  thick spike welded to the end, a blind portafilter with studs welded around
  the circumference. They tend toward an appearance of deadliness, and might
  actually be.
</p>

<h2 id="hal-bailmann">Hal Bailmann: Background</h2>
<p>
  Hal can&rsquo;t escape ever-creeping feeling he is not living up to his
  potential. Yet persists in a line of work out of stubbornness or a sense of
  duty or necessity. Loves and accepts people readily. It is palpable. People
  share thoughts and confide readily. He is granted tremendous latitude in
  relationships and at work and sort of counts on it. Sometimes he does pretty
  darn good work.
</p>
<p>
  First adventure: writing a piece on a small new company specializing in smart
  home systems for homes on remote islands in the Pacific. I and crew became
  stranded and cut off after an incident. An older member of the crew managed
  to improvise a signal boosting apparatus...satellite connect...bounce a
  signal and hail a boat. Hit home how much we take for granted ubiquitous
  global connectivity and its potential power and utility for those who
  understand how to use it.
