            <h2>Rash Decisions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Unused boosts expire</p>
<p>Stress clears</p>
<p>Situation: <em>Dark</em>, <em>Five-Oh Inbound</em></p>
<p>NPCs: Ramón, Karly, Naoto, Carol, over a hundred nervous passengers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s a short stunned silence in the group as the radio cuts off.</p>
<p>Tabby had been listening intently as Hal spoke to the FEMA person on the other end of the radio, listening for voice inflection, hesitation, or confusion. She notices she hadn&rsquo;t been using radio jargon like Hal had been. And the way she had paused and stuttered at times is giving Tabby the impression she was improvising, as if she has been forced to step up and take over even though it&rsquo;s not natural.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As weird as this is, something even stranger is going on over there,&rdquo; Tabby says, gesturing at the radio. &ldquo;That woman isn&rsquo;t used to this. Calling the shots, or whatever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marcus is still staring into the cab of the ambulance, as if waiting to hear something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weird that there isn&rsquo;t more chatter on that frequency. Hal, maybe try the other channels to see what&rsquo;s what,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>Hal obliges and tunes the radio up and down the band listening for heightened voices or anything seemingly related to the crash or rash. There are other dispatchers and responders on other frequencies. There&rsquo;s lots of jargon mixed in and it&rsquo;s difficult to understand.</p>
<p>A thought occurs to Hal and he slowly takes his hands off the radio with his palms open and forward. Asking everyone and no one, he offers to the group gathered, &ldquo;Do we have any idea or sense about how people are contracting this rash?&rdquo; His manners fail him and his eyes stop on Naoto.</p>
<p>Naoto grunts, too distracted to be much insulted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been touching and breathing the same stuff as everyone else. The radio is the least of your worries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, uh&hellip; yeah, sorry. Can you make anything out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Naoto frowns. &ldquo;Some of those are calls asking for other districts to lend support with their units. Otherwise typical stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marcus turns to the others with visible impatience. &ldquo;We should be able to find references to the crash as a breaking news story by now—some of us should check that on our phones. It would also help us discern if there is something larger afoot than just our plane crash. For instance, it strikes me as unusual and unlikely that a deputy regional administrator from FEMA is at emergency dispatch for the airport for a plane crash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; Sam says. &ldquo;Karly, you mind checking social media? Surely someone has posted something, maybe American Airlines or RDU has responded. I&rsquo;ll check news sites and other communications.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ramón shrugs and says he doesn&rsquo;t have his phone. &ldquo;Because <em>I</em> left my luggage on the plane,&rdquo; he adds, a little louder than necessary. Tabby and Karly get their phones out while Hal continues exploring the radio chatter.</p>
<p>Sam rummages through his bag and pulls out a small, rugged, almost military-looking tablet. He wipes off a few water drops with his shirt, the screen turns on and shows a lock screen for a couple seconds before springing to life.</p>
<p>Sam opens an app, hits &ldquo;scan all frequencies&rdquo; and a radar-like scanning icon is displayed momentarily before he swipes over to a news app, types in RDU and starts scrolling through the most recent news articles.</p>
<p>While the others are working, Marcus looks around the crowd to see if any of the passengers are using technology, expecting them to be calling loved ones or doing just what his companions are doing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create an Advantage: 2 Notice + 0 = 2 (Fair) <em>Success</em>, discovers aspect <em>Darn Technology</em> &#9744;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He notices that most people <em>aren&rsquo;t</em> on their devices. The ones that are are mildly agitated, shaking their heads or commenting to those next to them, as if to say, &ldquo;can you believe this thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ramón disappears behind the ambulance but quickly comes back. He&rsquo;s taken off his wet steward shirt and is wearing a reflective jacket with EMT logos on it. He walks over to the group while drying his hair in a towel.</p>
<p>Sam looks up from this laptop and gives him a quizzical look. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a steward, a jiu-jitsu ninja <em>and</em> an EMT?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ramon chuckles a little. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only shirt I found.&rdquo; Sam returns to his laptop, and Ramón catches Carol&rsquo;s eye. &ldquo;Excuse me, I&rsquo;m still worried, what do we know about this rash? Does it look like it&rsquo;s stress induced? Allergies? Could it be from the heat and smoke? Does it look like anything you&rsquo;ve seen before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Carol says, sighing, &ldquo;it could be any of that. People get rashes for all kinds of reasons and you usually never know why, they just go away. But all at once, on everyone? Beats me. I just make sure people are stable and call it in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half-panicked passenger comes over to Carol rattling off question after question, and she turns away from Ramón to intercept and calm them.</p>
<p>After a minute or 2 looking at news headlines, Sam switches to his scanning app, quickly glances over the results and doesn&rsquo;t notice anything out of the ordinary. He locks his tablet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only mention of the crash is on CNN,&rdquo; Sam says, &ldquo;but there is quite literally zero information other than &lsquo;a crash has been reported&rsquo;. You find anything Karly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh, no. There&rsquo;s something wrong with my Twitter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few people tweeted,&rdquo; Tabby adds, &ldquo;other passengers I guess. One guy even took a pretty sweet photo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, thanks,&rdquo; Hal says from the cab with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Ha, yeah, that&rsquo;s you, Hal. Nice. But no, nothing from the airport or the airline.&rdquo; Tabby stops for a second and lets out a sharp laugh. &ldquo;Ha. Get this&hellip; Our flight is marked as <em>&lsquo;Delayed&rsquo;</em>.&rdquo; She looks up at Sam with an incredulous look on her face. &ldquo;And practically all other flights from here are either delayed or cancelled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ok, that&rsquo;s weird, but it could be normal for an emergency,&rdquo; Sam points out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, but,&rdquo; Hal starts with a loud worried voice, which he quickly reduces to a whisper, &ldquo;targeted extraction of four people from a hundred or so, last-chopper-out-of-Saigon-style, is definitely not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without so much as a hot cocoa or a blanket,&rdquo; Marcus adds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you guys actually going to go with them?&rdquo; Karly asks.</p>
<p>Nobody can think of how to answer Karly&rsquo;s question for a bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, everyone, coming through!&rdquo; Mauve says clearly as she walks toward the ambulance from the crowd, still with her arm around the young girl. &ldquo;Susan is going to have a sit-down right in there.&rdquo; Carol is out of sight, and Naoto shows no inclination to get in Mauve&rsquo;s way. &ldquo;Lend me your jacket, young man,&rdquo; she says to Ramón, who promptly hands it over. &ldquo;There, honey, it&rsquo;s getting a little cooler and you&rsquo;ll want this,&rdquo; she says as she wraps it around Susan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I think we&rsquo;ve been here long enough,&rdquo; Mauve says to Naoto. How she knows Naoto is the one to speak to and not Ramón isn&rsquo;t at all obvious. &ldquo;No sense in waiting. I&rsquo;ve talked to some very nice people here and most of them are fine to travel, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll agree. We can fit a dozen in this great buggy, all cozy. A couple of trips back and forth won&rsquo;t take a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am we need to be on hand in case someone&rsquo;s condition changes suddenly,&rdquo; Naoto says, shaking his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do understand, my dear. And I know your partner over there can handle it. But <em>my</em> condition is elderly and tired and it&rsquo;s at risk of changing suddenly to serious pain your derriér,&rdquo; Mauve rubs Susan&rsquo;s shoulder as she says this to make it clear she&rsquo;s worried about more than herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve checked over most myself,&rdquo; Marcus says to Naoto, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve been watching; nobody&rsquo;s doing that badly. I think getting everyone out of here, even if it&rsquo;s not the fastest way, is a pretty good idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful,&rdquo; Mauve says, as if its been decided, &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; she says to Ramón, &ldquo;please go let everyone know they&rsquo;ll have a turn, and the good doctors will prioritize who gets on,&rdquo; and with that Mauve turns to fuss over Susan, clearly feeling her job has been done.</p>
<p>With Karly&rsquo;s question still hanging awkwardly over the conversation, Sam points into the distance where two sets of emergency lights emerge from the dark. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>Everyone turns to see. After staring and squinting a bit, it&rsquo;s clear there are three pairs of headlights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmph,&rdquo; says Ramón, not impressed. He turns on his heel and starts using his Steward-voice with the crowd. &ldquo;Everyone who can hear me, please gather around! Gather in, people, that&rsquo;s it. We&rsquo;re going to get some of the worst-off folks into the ambulance and back to the terminal. Please assist anyone who is having trouble walking or standing&hellip;&ldquo;</p>
<p>Hal looks between Tabby, Marcus, and Sam, trying to gauge their reactions. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not at all sure this is a good idea. I want to go home, not to a police station. I&rsquo;m willing to hear what they have to say, but unless I&rsquo;m under arrest&hellip;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds right,&rdquo; agrees Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, guys, they&rsquo;re not coming out here specifically for us without some <em>very good</em> reason. They don&rsquo;t even know our names,&rdquo; Marcus smirks at Hal, &ldquo;not even &lsquo;Mr. Bailman&rsquo; here. I&rsquo;m guessing they need our help with something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, like you said, they don&rsquo;t know us, why would they want us? To help with what?&rdquo; Tabby asks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This might sound silly, but I was in New York on 9/11, and this feels a little like that. There was this time where no one was sure exactly what was going on, how bad it was. But we knew it was bad. I watched people put absolutely everything on hold and go&hellip;&rdquo; Marcus trails off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus!&rdquo; Sam says, &ldquo;You think something like 9/11 is going on out there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fucking <em>FEMA</em>,&rdquo; Hal says quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we go,&rdquo; Tabby says, nodding toward the vehicles pulling up. There are two squad cars and a shuttle bus with &ldquo;Dollar&rdquo; written on the side. One uniformed officer gets out of each car, and the bus driver stays put. The added headlight beams change the position of all the shadows and make it feel like they are suddenly in a different place.</p>
<div class="character"><p>Sergeant William Dustice, ???</p>
<p>Dark uniforms, full police gear.</p>
<p><em>Determined to Follow Orders</em>, <em>Arm of the Law</em></p></div>

<p>The officers walk forward with that easy-but-careful stroll of police assessing a scene, coming straight toward the four while scanning all around. They stop at a conversational distance, one man beside and slightly behind the other. They don&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
<p>Tabby breaks first. &ldquo;Good evening, officers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They both nod, and the man in front, with three stripes on his sleeve, says, &ldquo;Evening. Glad to see so few people are hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ramón comes walking briskly up and says, &ldquo;Is that shuttle for us? We&rsquo;ve got a lot of people who want to get out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go right ahead,&rdquo; the Sergeant days, but he doesn&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great,&rdquo; Ramón says and goes to talk to the bus driver.</p>
<p>Sam clear his throat, but doesn&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you want to tell us what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Hal asks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You the four that dispatch mentioned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s us,&rdquo; Marcus says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, we can fill you in. Just step over here to the cars.&rdquo; Each of the four do their own idiosyncratic version of a deep breath and follow the cops over to the cars. The same Sergeant starts speaking quietly, forcing them to form a tight circle so they can hear him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t very much information. But it seems like the rash is very wide spread. Deputy Kendrick is working to gather everyone who is not affected for special assignments. You&rsquo;re to take these two units,&rdquo; the Sergeant gestures at the cars, &ldquo;and get on I-40. Deputy Kendrick will get in touch over the radio with next steps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam, who has put his tablet away and slung his duffel bag over his shoulder, says &ldquo;Wait, you&rsquo;re saying WE get to drive the cop cars?? Now <em>that</em> I&rsquo;m ok with!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tabby&rsquo;s eyes light up. &ldquo;So what are <em>you</em> going to do?&rdquo; she asks the police officers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be assisting everyone here getting to the terminal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam turns to Karly and says, &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ll be going with Ramón and the other passengers. Give me your number and we can get a drink when all this blows over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright, stay safe. I&rsquo;m gonna go drive in a cop car!&rdquo; Sam grins.</p>
<p>Karly heads off with Ramón towards the bus. Sam turns back to the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These officers might not actually know anything more. I&rsquo;m gonna go talk to this Kendrick person over the radio—get right to the source.&rdquo; he says, as he starts walking towards the nearest squad car.</p>
<p>Marcus puts out a hand and calmly but firmly interrupts Sam&rsquo;s swagger forward.</p>
<p>Sam smiles as if he was never serious anyway. Marcus addresses both officers, frowning slightly. &ldquo;We were led to believe you&rsquo;d have more information about the bigger picture of what is going on—is this all you can tell us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sergeant crosses his arms and doesn&rsquo;t speak at first. He takes a deep breath. &ldquo;I get that you&rsquo;re concerned,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I can tell you this is important.&rdquo; His arms stay crossed.</p>
<p>Deadpan, Hal adds, &ldquo;pretty please. With sugar on top. The fuck is going on?&rdquo; This gets a glance from the Sergeant, but nothing else.</p>
<p>Marcus takes a small step forward and offers his right hand as he introduces himself and flashes his credentials with his left. &ldquo;Marcus Cain, FDNY. I understand that you might be light on information right now. We&rsquo;ve all only just gotten off that plane still on fire behind me so, understandably, we&rsquo;re a bit on edge—more so with the added strangeness. Mind if we ask you a few questions? All we hope for is your honest appraisal. You look to have been on the job for a bit sergeant so let&rsquo;s start with what your gut is telling you. If need be, you can tell it to me and I can filter it to the rest, I filter well.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marcus Create an Advantage: 1 Rapport + 3 = 4 (Great) <em>Success</em>, creates aspect for Sergeant, <em>One of the Brotherhood</em> &#9744;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Sergeant&rsquo;s arms come down and he hooks his thumbs in his belt. &ldquo;No, no. No need for a filter. Everyone&rsquo;s got at right to the basics, which is, number one, we absolutely cannot make the mistake of letting our imaginations get carried away here. Number two, this isn&rsquo;t anything anyone has seen before. Not that we can&rsquo;t handle it, mind you. But what we need right now is for certain folks such as yourselves who are handling everything well to lend their assistance. The Deputy is calling the shots for the local districts, at least for now, and I&rsquo;m in direct command of forces here at the airport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a brief pause while everyone takes this in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In any case,&rdquo; the Sergeant continues, &ldquo;I need to see ID and and get numbers from each of you.</p>
<p>Marcus hands his over, which he already had out, without comment. The Sergeant takes it and looks expectantly at the others.</p>
<p>Marcus turns first to Sam and then the others. &ldquo;Come on, it sounds like the quicker we cooperate the quicker we will figure out how we all get home.&rdquo; Turning back to the officer, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s highly irregular to be asking for civilian help—your call or FEMA&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Correct, sir, it is. Thank you,&rdquo; he says as he hands back Marcus&rsquo; ID. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d agree that some of the things you&rsquo;ve seen tonight are irregular. Originally the Deputy&rsquo;s call but she consulted me and my CO and we&rsquo;re all in agreement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever lets me drive around in a cop car!&rdquo; Sam grins as he pulls out his passport with the boarding pass still in it. &ldquo;I guess this is useless now&hellip;&rdquo;
He crumples up the boarding pass, stuffs it in his pocket and hands his passport over to the sergeant.</p>
<p>Tabby fumbles around in her bag and pulls out a blue plastic Hello Kitty wallet. She removes her ID and hands it to the officer with a self-aware smile. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that everything today is a new experience for all of us. Not that we can&rsquo;t handle it,&rdquo; she tacks on with a nod and wink.</p>
<p>Hal nods politely and hands over his license as well, all the while intently studying both officers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because Sam is a <em>Security Systems Neutralizer For Hire</em> it makes sense the police recognize his name. Damn his luck. +1 fate point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Sergeant, studying Sam&rsquo;s passport, smiles with just the side of his mouth and says, &ldquo;Dunbar. Hey Phil, look at this,&rdquo; as he passes it back to his partner.</p>
<p>The partner says, taking it, &ldquo;The B&amp;E hacker? This guy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very same. So, um&hellip; Yeah, Phil, let&rsquo;s not provide Mr. Dunbar with access to the laptops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can put &lsquo;em in the ambulance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; The Sergeant finishes writing down Sam&rsquo;s information and waves at Phil to pass back the ID. &ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Dunbar. Hope to see you again some day under better circumstances.&rdquo; Phil, shaking his head, goes and sits in the first squad car and starts detaching the swivel-mounted laptop.</p>
<p>Tabby&rsquo;s eyebrows raise as she looks at Sam. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a Hacker? Like in that 90s movie my older cousin used to always watch when I was little? What&rsquo;s your handle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not sure what hacker makes you think of, but I&rsquo;m an expert in security systems. Sure, I&rsquo;m in some online groups that attract people with&hellip;&ldquo;</p>
<p>As Sam is talking, the Sergeant starts to move—calmly enough not to make anyone jump but quickly enough to give Sam little time to react. He raises his arm with some kind of gadget in his hand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sergeant Attack: 2 Fight - 1 + 2 <em>Arm of the Law</em> = 3 (Good), -1 fate point
7:43
Sam Defend: 0 Fight - 2 = -2 (Terrible) <em>Fails</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;less than ideal motives, but that doesn&rsquo;t make me a crimin-AAAAOOOW.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam flinches, just a little, but otherwise is oblivious to what&rsquo;s happening. There&rsquo;s a click-snap sound, and Sam feels a sting in his arm. The Sergeant truly smiles for the first time. &ldquo;Heh. Be seeing you, Mr. Dunbar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! What the hell was that?&rdquo; Sam cries out, putting his hand up to his shoulder to feel this thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re GPS-enabled now!&rdquo; laughs Officer Phil, as he walks past them with the laptops in his arms.</p>
