<h1>Regression</h1>

<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>
  I'm focusing on building the universe to the point where you all can start tearing shit up. Might take a week or two before I can provide enough background for character building to start in earnest.
</p>
<p>
  In the meantime, the following is known: 2017 is in the past, but not by much. Reality is perfectly familiar; there are no pre-2017 alternate histories and no new laws of nature. Fighters will definitely have a place, so feel free to imagine what kind of combat skills you'd like your character to have. Although most other modern professional skills will be very important.
</p>


<h2>Game System</h2>
<p>
  We'll use the <a href="https://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core-downloads/">Fate Core System</a>, with some small exceptions. I want room for the characters to grow quickly at the beginning, so we're going to simplify the "phase trio" part of character setup and include just High Concept, Trouble, and "first adventure" aspects. Also we'll limit ourselves to one stunt at first. I think it will be more fun to discover more aspects and stunts during play. So please familiarize yourself with the rules, and consider a character background story and what aspects, stunts, and skills you might want.
</p>
<h3>Modified Skills</h3>
<p>
  The <em>Crafts</em> skill is divided in this game world into <em>Hardware</em> and <em>Software</em>. <em>Hardware</em> is just like <em>Crafts</em> in the vanilla system. <em>Software</em> is the skill of working with computer systems. For Overcome or Create and Advantage actions, it allows you to break or fix a computer's behavior, or devise a novel program. The Attack and Defend actions are only applicable if your character has had preparation time and managed to gain control of some fly-by-wire mechanism.
</p>

<h2>Character Requirements</h2>

<p>
  Your characters need a reason to be on a plane departing Raleigh NC roughly in the spring months. It doesn't matter where they come, but avoid being specific about where you're going because you're all on the same plane and it can only go one place!
</p>
<p>
  You and another player can agree that your characters know each other, or you can say they don’t know anyone in the group. You can have deeply held secrets and only tell me. In that last case, you should probably hint at your character’s mystery with your aspect(s).
</p>

<h2>Preview of Gameplay</h2>

<p>
  Because playing async will be very slow compared to table top, I'm going to do what I can to make mechanics simple and fast. I don't think that spending a week where the most that happens is a couple of punches would be fun.
</p>
<p>
  One consequence of this is that player submissions should full of conditionals. Since the GM and other players aren't there as you're writing to say exactly what would happen next, prepare actions for multiple responses.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    I put my hand on my holster, but I don't draw right away. Unless I see anyone trying to move around behind me, then I draw on the closest target.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Also player submissions should be full of <em>their own storytelling</em>. I'll give wide latitude to players defining how the world and NPCs respond to them. If I need to veto or alter something, I'll do so before posting updates.
</p>
<p>
  I'll combine submissions, sort out decision trees, add narration, borrowing heavily from what you guys have written, and post the results on the main storyline.
</p>
<p>
  Probably I'll also include the specific mechanics I or the player used when they're interesting.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <code>
    Attack roll was X with bonus +Y and +Z, a near fail.
  </code>
  <p>
    Yoreg's shot misses wide, but strikes a metal drum creating such a loud sound that everyone is stunned for a moment.
  </p>
