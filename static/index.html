<h1>Regression</h1>

<h2>Backstory</h2>
<p>
  In the five years since 2017, two nations have been erased by Russian annexation, one has drowned beneath the rising seas, the South China Sea belongs to the PRC, AI has soaked deeper into the fabric of the first world, little has changed for the poor, and humans have returned to the moon.
</p>
<p>
  The Trump administration never got off the ground geopolitically. After it became clear the Commander in Chief could neither strategize effectively nor accept advice from those who could, Russia and China made decisive moves, anticipating a weak response from the World&rsquo;s Policeman. Russia has annexed Georgia and Estonia, and China has declared that it would start enforcing it&rsquo;s &ldquo;border&rdquo; in the South China Sea and moved in the oil rigs. In both cases US forces pulled back without incident.
</p>
<p>
  The island nation of Tuvalu, without the wealth or credit to reinforce its infrastructure and facing imminent sea level rise that would displace half its population, has instructed all of its citizens to evacuate, becoming a stateless nation.
</p>
<p>
  Gary Herbert, former governor of Utah, got ahold of some (finally) sufficiently damning evidence of Trump&rsquo;s character and was elected on a values-and-fiscal-responsibility platform. The GOP&rsquo;s flirtation with the nationalist right has become less overt but is still earning them votes.
</p>
<p>
  Research into and commercialization of machine learning algorithms has advanced rapidly and digital services in general are significantly better as a result. AI embedded in networks and operating systems make devices and connections more responsive by learning and predicting user&rsquo;s actions. Software design is heavily aided by AI so the excellent usability of applications and interfaces previously limited to top-tier firms is widespread. Many sectors of the economy are notably more efficient because their logistics are being optimized by AI. Self-driving cars are common on the roads and consensus is gradually spreading that they save lives on average.
</p>
<p>
  The trend toward income inequality has continued, but the trickle of improvements in everyday conveniences has prevented any serious unrest from gathering.
</p>
<p>
  Countries outside the G20 have shown no remarkable changes in prosperity, although humanitarian efforts to increase quality of life for the very poor have continued. The WHO has begun to project a peak in the sub-Saharan AIDS crisis; several gambits to reduce malaria-carrying mosquito populations have gone well. But most of the world&rsquo;s people still live chaotic, improverished lives.
</p>
<p>
  SpaceX backed off its timeline to land its crewed spacecraft on Mars several times, but has landed four astronauts on the Moon. Conspiracy theorists allow the SpaceX landing was real but maintain the Apollo landings were still fake. Commerical rocketry has come into its own with several other companies refining low cost-to-orbit rockets.
</p>
<p>
  The moon landing highlighted, by its lack of dramatic impact on the public&rsquo;s imagination, a growing ennui in the US. Progressives are more intimidated by the resilience of reactionary ideas, average people are beginning to feel the glow fading from American Exceptionalism, daily life is rich with entertainment but thin with real or gainful work.
</p>
<h2>Our Story Begins</h2>
<p>
  On a plane, bound to San Antonio, on the tarmac of Raleigh-Durham International Airport, at 8:26 pm on the 6th of May, 2022. There have been delays getting the passengers on board and a long wait here in the plane and they still haven&rsquo;t pulled away from the terminal. Even though it&rsquo;s late, it&rsquo;s still hot, and the cabin&rsquo;s air conditioning can&rsquo;t quite keep up. Voices can be heard over the intercom.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;-n&rsquo;t matter to me, go ahead.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Yeah, okay. Wait, why isn&rsquo;t this&hellip;&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;You have to, hang on&hellip; why is this damn thing so confusing. Oh-&ldquo;, the voice switches to a whisper, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, yeah, it&rsquo;s already on.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
  Passengers look up from what they&rsquo;re doing, some looking at each other quizzically. Someone on the other end of the intercom clears their throat.
</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;We apologize for the delays, folks, and we&rsquo;ll be getting you off to San Antonio as quickly as possible. We&rsquo;re just waiting on some paperwork for the plane&rsquo;s maintenance and then we&rsquo;ll be off. Should be another few minutes.&rdquo;
</p>

<h1>Setup Notes and Miscellaneous, To Be Retired</h1>

<h2>Game System</h2>
<p>

  We'll use the <a href="https://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core-downloads/">Fate Core System</a>, with some small exceptions. I want room for the characters to grow quickly at the beginning, so we're going to simplify the "phase trio" part of character setup and include just High Concept, Trouble, and "first adventure" aspects. Also we'll limit ourselves to one stunt at first. I think it will be more fun to discover more aspects and stunts during play.

</p>
<p>

  So please familiarize yourself with the rules, and consider a character background story and what aspects, stunts, and skills you might want. I do plan on some <em>light</em> skills customization.

</p>

<h2>Character Requirements</h2>

<p>

  Your characters need a reason to be on a plane departing Raleigh NC roughly in the spring months. It doesn't matter where they come, but avoid being specific about where you're going because you're all on the same plane and it can only go one place!

</p>
<p>

  You and another player can agree that your characters know each other, or you can say they don’t know anyone in the group. You can have deeply held secrets and only tell me. In that last case, you should probably hint at your character’s mystery with your aspect(s).

</p>

<h2>Preview of Gameplay</h2>

<p>

  Because playing async will be very slow compared to table top, I'm going to do what I can to make mechanics simple and fast. I don't think that spending a week where the most that happens is a couple of punches would be fun.

</p>
<p>

  One consequence of this is that player submissions should full of conditionals. Since the GM and other players aren't there as you're writing to say exactly what would happen next, prepare actions for multiple responses.

</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    I put my hand on my holster, but I don't draw right away. Unless I see anyone trying to move around behind me, then I draw on the closest target.

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>

  Also player submissions should be full of <em>their own storytelling</em>. I'll give wide latitude to players defining how the world and NPCs respond to them. If I need to veto or alter something, I'll do so before posting updates.

</p>
<p>

  I'll combine submissions, sort out decision trees, add narration, borrowing heavily from what you guys have written, and post the results on the main storyline.

</p>
<p>

  Probably I'll also include the specific mechanics I or the player used when they're interesting.

</p>
<blockquote>
  <code>
    Attack roll was X with bonus +Y and +Z, a near fail.
  </code>
  <p>
    Yoreg's shot misses wide, but strikes a metal drum creating such a loud sound that everyone is stunned for a moment.

</p>
