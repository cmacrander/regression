Sam had been searching through some cyber security forums for information about the tracker in his arm. He hasn't found anything definitive, but some rumors that the thing's battery won't last more than a few days, and that it may be possible to fry it with the right kind of EM pulse.

He stops his browsing and notes the address of their desination when he hears it, then pulls it up on a map.

"Tabby, Hal, did you guys get that?" Sam asks.

"Yes, we heard that."

"Follow us, I’ve got the route mapped out. Uhhh&hellip; Sam out and over&hellip; or, um, over and&hellip; whatever." He releases the talk switch, and says for Marcus' benefit, "Stupid radio babble."

Sam immediately feels better when he notices a certain switch on the dashboard. He looks over to Marcus and grins as he switches on the police lights.

Marcus opens his mouth to say something, but then closes it again, and just keeps driving.

In the other car, Hal is both driving and entertaining himself by providing unnecessary narration over the car's loudspeaker.

"CHANGING LANES. ON YOUR LEFT."

He stops and smiles to himself as he realizes that he recognizes the Sergeant: a minor league ball player who never got called up to majors but enjoyed a brief career as a baseball star in Japan. Gride, that was it, he thinks. Sergeant Jeromy Gride.

"JUNCTION WITH 540 IN 3 MILES."

Tabby doesn't react because she's absorbed in what she's just heard from Deputy Kendrick.

"So, let me get this straight: We're supposed to _kidnap_ this doctor if she doesn't come along with us? Hal, what the _fuck_ is going on?"

Hal shrugs with honest humility. "I'm not sure, but I think it might just be weird government speak. She probably didn't mean it exactly that way."

Tabby snorts, "Her answer to Marcus' question was pretty plain."

"It's not a kidnapping yet; we haven't plead our case."

"Look, I don't mean to overreact here, _but why aren't you overreacting to this_?"

Hal grins a little, embarassed, but instead of answering, gets back on the loudspeaker, "WATCH YOUR DRIFT THERE, COWBOY."

"Give me that!" Hal lets Tabby take the handset from him unconstested. "Umm, Car 2&hellip; or whatever&hellip; I need to know: we not seriously doing this, right? Did I miss something about laws and ethics? 'Aquire' her?"

"Sam here. We're only picking her up, why wouldn't she want to come? She apparently signed up for this, what with her having 'instructions in case of emergency' and all&hellip; Over. And, um&hellip; It's the middle of the night, and we're expecting her to be at her lab? Over again. Oh, um this was Sam again. Over-over."



Hal makes a quizzical expression in passing as a reaction to the preposition stew. "He makes a good point," he says to Tabby, "but will she even be there? Maybe a good chance just by virtue of it being a lifestyle job. But if she is not how do we find her? Also, what credential are we going to present to convince her of the legitimacy of our errand?" Tabby nods and relays these questions to the other car.

In "Car 2" Marcus gestures for Sam to pass back the handset. "If she's not there," he says into the radio, "then Sam can certainly find her address on the company intranet, and that would be our next stop. That being said, I feel our first stop should be a Wal-Mart. We need more gear than just what we were able to grab on our way off the airplane that crashed."

Marcus pauses for a moment clicks the talk switch again. "Car 1, we clearly still don’t have all the information. I completely understand that this is all off-putting. I need coffee and I think we all need more gear than we have right now. And a discussion of our next step couldn't hurt. Keep following us. Over." Marcus sets the handset in its cradle.

"Sam, see if you can’t find a Wal-Mart or it’s equivalent nearby off the highway. Thanks."

"Tabby and I agree. See if you can find one that is also near a Home Depot."

Sam says, "It’s the middle of the night, everything is closed," as he stabs and swipes at his tablet. "Or not. There's a Walmart in Clegg... and it's open 24/7. Get onto the 540 West coming up!"

"Sam here, Car 2. Theres a Walmart off 540 that's open. We’re heading there now. I’m all for grabbing some dry clothes but what do you guys need? Kidnapping supplies? Sam out. Errrrr, over."

"We're Car 1, and _your_ name is Sam," Hal responds, "Over."

"What? Dammit, I give up."

Sam starts searching the Internet for information about Dr. Kristine Griffin as they make their way to the Wal-Mart, and finds out she runs the Neurotoxicology Group at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. There are plenty of hits, but they're all very esoteric academic proceedings, citations, abstracts, and the like. Sam adds the search term "virus" and again finds plenty of hits, but doesn't understand them.

The party arrives at the Wal-Mart in short order and pulls into its expansive parking lot. Marcus parks quickly, choosing a distant, darker, empty portion of the lot. Hal parks next to him.

Tabby gets out and then makes room for Marcus who is right beside her. She says, "Looks like they've got a McDonald's in there. I think we should get coffees and sit and make a l—" She stops and looks down as something clatters to the pavement at her feet.

"Yeah, I could use one. Sounds good." Before he can ask what Tabby's looking at, two vehicles rattling with bass and blazing with after-market headlights swoop by, distracting him. When they pass, Marcus looks left and right to see if Sam and Hal are on board with the plan, but then the rear of the two vehicles stops, sounds its horn for a second, and reverses quickly. The one in front also stops, and a second later the driver gets the idea and also reverses.

A cocky-sounding male leaning out the high passenger side window of a 4x4 on large tires says, "You motherfuckers ain't no cops."

Tabby stands back up from picking up the fallen object. No one sees because they're all looking at the newcomers, but her hand tightens reflexively around her new acquisition: a police baton.
