## RDU

On a plane, bound to San Antonio, on the tarmac of Raleigh-Durham International Airport, at 8:26 pm on the 6th of May, 2022. There have been delays getting the passengers on board and a long wait here in the plane and they still haven't pulled away from the terminal. Even though it's late, it's still hot, and the cabin's air conditioning can't quite keep up. Voices can be heard over the intercom.

"-n't matter to me, go ahead."

"Yeah, okay. Wait, why isn't this..."

"You have to, hang on... why is this damn thing so confusing. Oh—", the voice switches to a whisper, "it's, it's, yeah, it's already on."

Passengers look up from what they're doing, some looking at each other quizzically. Someone on the other end of the intercom clears their throat.

"We apologize for the delays, folks, and we'll be getting you off to San Antonio as quickly as possible. We're just waiting on some paperwork for the plane's maintenance and then we'll be off. Should be just another few minutes."

Half an hour later the plane pulls away from the gate. It taxis to the runway and aligns itself.

"Attendants prepare for crosscheck."

Many passengers relax their shoulders and sigh. The plane's engines spin up and the wings start to catch the air. But things feel wrong immediately and everyone either gasps or screams as the plane leaps upward. There's a sickening sideways tilt to the whole cabin and a sudden drop and everyone screams again. Phones and books crash into the ceiling and fly everywhere. The plane's nose sharply twists down again as the rear crashes into the runway. There's a rush of heat and a shimmer from the right side where a wing is dragging along the ground. With a deafening noise the plane skids to a halt half off the side of the runway.

----

Marcus is one of the first on the plane to collect his wits. He quickly jumps out of his seat and rushes to the aid of the stewardess—who had been sitting by the left rear exit—attempting to open the rear escape hatch. She is having a _very_ hard time opening the hatch. She's trying to pull the red bar in towards her body (it is clearly labeled that it turns down). She knows she's supposed to be able to do this and is on the verge of losing mental control entirely.

```character

Black, smoothed-back hair, shorter than average.

```

Without hesitating, Marcus powers past her and muscles open the door.

> Overcome: 3 Physique + 3 = 6 (Fantastic) _Succeeds with Style_ +1 boost

The stewardess is unceremoniously knocked back into the galley and Marcus detaches and tosses out the door as if it were weightless. The emergency slide explosively deploys. Marcus steps back to the main aisle and roars loudly, "Everyone off the plane! Exit on the left, not on the right! If you are injured and unable to move, you will be helped!" He takes his time observing the scene as he stays out of the way of the aisle

> Create an Advantage: 0 Notice + 3 = 3 (Good) _Succeeds_ +1 free invocation on new aspect _The Nearest Exit May Be Behind You_

and sees that the exit doors over the left wing are not open yet. He realizes his exit is crucial, but that it's behind everyone and likely to go unnoticed. He tries to be a calming but directing influence.

> Overcome: 1 Rapport - 1  + 2 boost + 2 _The Nearest Exit May Be Behind You_ = 4 (Great) _Succeeds_

With a loud but clear and authoritative voice, Marcus urges everyone within range to come toward him and go down the slide. The rear of the plane clears much more quickly that it otherwise would have, given the widespread panic. He decides the next most useful thing he could do is help the stewardess recover from her shock so she can assist people going down the slide.

> Overcome: 1 Rapport - 3 = -2 (Terrible) _Fails_

Just coming out of a daze caused by minor head injuries, she interprets Marcus' attempts to help her off the floor as a second attack on her person and throws her arms in front of her face and screams repeatedly.

Slightly embarassed but in no mood to stop to consider it, Marcus takes advantage of her confusion, picks her up bodily, and tosses her out the door and down the slide

> Attack: 1 Fight + 1 + 2 _Extremely Confused_  = 4 (Great) _Succeeds with Style_ +1 boost, -1 fate point

The stewardess vertiably sails out the hatch and lands square in the middle of the slide.

Marcus looks back into the cabin and at first glance...

> Overcome: 0 Notice + 1 = 1 (Average) _Fails_

...fails to see anyone left. Recognizing he can only see a small part of the plane he attempts to climb forward to clear the rest

> Overcome: Athletics 2 - 1 = 1 (Average) _Fails_

and stumbles over carry-ons and has trouble seeing in the smoke. He works his way slowly back to the emergency slide, squinting through the smoke and listening as hard as he can, but is interrupted by a flare of red light from further up the plane. His experiences with fire tell him he will be in serious trouble very soon and that he would need a SCBA to help anyone that might remain anyway.

Feeling hopeful that he's done all he can in the plane, he quickly exits. Upon getting to the bottom he moves away from the plane, looking to see if anyone is in distress that might need help

> Create an Advantage: 0 Notice + 2 = 2 (Fair) _Succeeds with Style_

and he immediately notices the same thing that Sam just has: a crash tender is on scene but isn't jetting water or doing anything else useful.

Tabby never imagined that being seated in an emergency exit row would ever bear relevance, but now the universe has seen fit to provide her with an opportunity. She gathers her wits as best she can; during the chaos she bumped heads with the man in the white shirt and tie next to her. She feels a small trickle of warm blood at her temple, but her row-mate did not fair as well: he seems to be unconscious. Tabby sees that the duty of opening the emergency hatch has now fallen to her, and she's almost excited about it. But without even looking, the heat on the right side of her face communicates the intensity of the fire burning on the wing just outside. No one is getting out that way. Her head swivels to the left and she squints through the smoke.

> Overcome: 1 Notice + 0 = 1 (Fair) _Fails_

There are people and smoke around the port wing emergency exits, but Tabby knows she'll have to get closer to see any better. Tabby hesitates only a second looking down at the unconscious man beside her. She quickly removes the bandana holding back her hair and ties it around her mouth to block out the smoke. "I'll be back," she says to the man, unbuckling his seat belt, although the words were more for her than for him. She glances around, memorizing her row and checking that the fire doesn't seem to be an immediate danger to him.

Tabby steps across the aisle to get a sense of what's going on by the emergency exit, and starts to cue in to the harried conversation there. She can't get any closer than the aisle seat of that row.

"&hellip;what I'm _doing_ for Chrissake"

"You'll never get it that way, get your—"

"Gethefuck _off_ and let me—"

This is going nowhere, Tabby thinks.

> Overcome: 1 Rapport + 2 = 3 (Good) _Succeeds_

"This is no time to fight, we need cool heads!" The unexpected voice interrupts the dynamic of the two men arguing. They turn to look, are suitably impressed by her bandana-mask, and open a little space so she can get at the hatch. "I got this, guys."

> Overcome: 4 Hardware + 0 = 4 (Great) _Succeeds with Style_ +1 boost

Tabby sees immediately how the inflatable slide ties in and makes sure it deploys. Then she steps back and waves the others forward. As soon as she can, she goes back and attempts to wake her row-mate.

He's out cold. Tabby sets her core and attempts to carry him across the aisle to safety.

> Overcome: 2 Physique + 0 + 2 _I Just Wanna Help_ = 4 (Great) _Succeeds_, -1 fate point

The strength of her spirit and determination get her and the muderously heavy man to the hatch. One of the flight crew is at the base of the slide, signalling for her to send her burden down. Positioning him as best she can, she lets him go. His head drags along the side of the slide, but he's in no worse shape than he was, assuming he doesn't have a spinal cord injury.

Tabby steps back to look around again. A last few people rush out the hatch, but Tabby can't see anyone else. The heat in the cabin is getting very severe and sweat is running into her eyes and bandana.

Questioning her own judgment, she wades forward through the smoke to make a final check.

> Overcome: 2 Athletics + 0 = 2 (Fair) _Succeeds_

She doesn't see anyone, and can't hear anything over a roar of fire and occasional screeches of metal. The plane lurches and tilts, and several of the overhead bins drop open, some spilling luggage onto the floor.

> Situation Aspect: _Luggage Everywhere_

I could definitely die right now, Tabby thinks, time to go. She turns back to the exit she opened, several rows back.

> Overcome: 2 Athletics - 1 = 1 (Average) _Fails_, 1 shift stress from intensifying fire

Hit by a coughing spasm and tripped by a sliding bag, Tabby sprawls to the aisle floor. As she pushes herself up, she realizes its her carry-on: her grandfather's old travel welding kit. In the same moment a gout of fire pierces one of the starboard windows, giving her first degree burns across the back of her neck and arms. She clutches the bag and furiously dives out of the plane, a puff of human-shaped smoke.

----

As the plane comes to a halt and black smoke engulfs the cabin, Sam quickly looks himself over to make sure nothing is broken. Other than a slight pain in his shin and some ringing in his ear, he seems to still be in one piece. He quickly undoes his seat belt and throws his only remaining wireless earbud to the floor—who knows where the other one went.

The woman to his left seems to be slowly coming to her senses—she'll be fine—and the man to his right is fumbling with his seat belt. Sam steps around him and stands in the aisle. As he opens the overhead bin and reaches for his trusty duffel bag, he looks around to see where the smoke is coming from and where he should head to.

Before he can get a good look, a very loud voice behind him screams, "NO LUGGAGE!!" and suddenly hands are on him.

```character
**Steward**

```


> Defend: 0 Fight - 2 = -2 (Terrible) _Fails_

In blur of focused leverage and superior grip, Sam's bag is ripped out of his hands, his shoulders are wrenched around so he is forced to face forward, and a severe knee in the ass sends him stumbling through the first class curtain. The overhead compartment he had opened snaps shut behind him. "ABSOLUTELY NO LUGGAGE!! EXIT FORWARD!!"

Sam falls to his knees but grabs onto the arm-rest of an empty seat to stop himself falling forward. As he starts pushing himself up, he notices a fancy cell phone under the seat and a small bottle of whiskey in the seat pocket. As he pushes himself up with him left hand, he quickly drops both items into his jacket pocket with his right hand.

As he stands up, he looks back at the steward but can barely see through the black smoke. It looks like he's helping another passenger undo his seat belt. Sam makes his way to the front of the plane where the door is already open with the first class passengers. He follows the line of people jogging away from the plane.

As he's walking with the crowd, Sam takes a second to open his newly acquired bottle of whiskey and downs it. "Nothing like some cheap whiskey to clear your head," he thinks, as he looks back at the plane and surveys the scene.

> Create an Advantage: 2 Notice + 0 = 2 (Fair) _Succeeds_

Predictably, there is a crash tender inbound, and as Sam watches, anticipating the pleasant distance of a whiskey buzz, it gets within range of the burning plane and slams on the brakes. Unpredictably, it does not begin doing anything about the fire. Sam stands passively for a moment, convinced he's wrong, but he sees the coated figures inside become more and more agitated, and realizes he has to act.

> Situation Aspect: _You're Doing it Wrong_ with 1 free invocation

What Sam _doesn't_ see as he stares at the firetruck is a man, just dismounting from the forward slide, wearing a light-colored suit, impossibly-still-in-place dark glasses, and carrying a worn dufflebag, who had been inches from garotting Sam before the assertive Steward intervened.

Hal is rattled but level-headed and checks on his neighbors in the row. One is a kid flying alone the other is also a grandma with huge wireless headphones. She too seems pretty calm about the whole thing. The kid is scared. He unbuckles his lap belt and looks around for an exit through the smoke.

> Overcome: 3 Notice + 0 = 3 (Good) _Succeeds_

He sees a tall man moving powerfully to open the emergency exit back and to the left, smoke rushing out into the daylight, while the emergency exits forward and to the left are a tangled mass of people.

Hal steps out into the aisle, intending to blockade it for the old lady to step out. Frantic people are trying to get toward the back.

> Defend: 0 Fight - 1 = -1 (Poor) _Fails_

He finds himself rudely shoved back into his row. Hal grabs his backpack from under his seat and winks at the kid, "S'okay, I needed this anyway," hoping to exude confidence and calm her down.

> Overcome: 1 Rapport + 1 = 2 (Fair) _Tie_

The girl takes Hal's hand but also starts sobbing uncontrollably. The old lady hasn't said a word, but her body language declares that she's ready to pounce on a chance to get into that aisle. Hal leads the way a second time, with much greater success. It seems everyone who had noticed the rear exit is out already. Keeping their heads low, the three move quickly back. Hal doesn't let the girl think about the next part; he puts his other hand low on her back and push-pulls her forward until she's half running out the hatch, her wail doppler-shifting all the way down the slide. Two more blinks of an eye and he's out. Helpful passengers are grabbing people's hands and yanking them up as they land. He turns to see his sturdy row-mate perform a perfect legs-in-front cross-armed leap. She dusts off her skirt and stands with Hal's help and says, "Diving Team."

Marcus has just realized something is very wrong with first responders that have arrived. He's not sure there's anyone left on the plane, but is isn't sure there's not, either, so the fact that nothing is being done about the first is intolerable. The engine looks pretty different than the one's he's worked with, but he's suddenly confident he could be doing better than whoever is operating the thing.

Breathing raggedly, Marcus sprints over to it, praying he can make a better impression on them than he did on the stewardess. He hoarsely shouts that he's FDNY and can help.

> Overcome: 1 Rapport - 1 + 2 _You're Doing it Wrong_ + 2 _FDNY Paramedic_ = 4 (Great) _Ties_, -1 fate point

"What's wrong?" Marcus shouts into the cabin of the tender from the side step.

"There's something wrong with it, I think the pressure—"

The other fire fighter jumps in, "The pressure's fine, look, you haven't got it set so—"

"I knew the old one backwards and forwards..." with each exchange the fire fighters' pitch increases and their eyes get wider. The radio is crackling with chatter that Marcus can't make out.

"Let me in so I can see what's going on," Marcus interrupts.

"You can't just come in here and—"

"That fucking plane—which probably still has people on it—is fucking _on fire_ and you two are standing here holding your dicks! Fucking let me help!"

"Shit! Okay. See if you can do better, asshole. Mufid, call—"

Marcus slides up and looks around and instantly sees conspicuous indicator lights with clear labels that stand out from the bank controls.

> Overcome: 4 Lore - 2 = 2 (Fair) _Ties_

His background knowledge and exposure to fire engines combined with the fact that it's practically telling him what to do enable Marcus to deploy the arm and water. However, the arm is aiming somewhat perpendicular to the tender when high-pressure water is suddenly released, which is enough to tip Marcus back out of the cabin, landing him on his ass on the runway.

The fire fighters still inside seem to have caught on to what to do next and they quickly get the arm pointed in the right direction.

----

Sam sees the same curiously ineffective crash tender. He quickly looks at the people next to him in the crowd and singles out a tall young woman wearing a Nike t-shirt and some running shoes who looks calm despite the situation. Sam's mind goes back to his past in the corporate world where he used to be particularly good at schmoozing with higher up to get what he wants. He grabs her attention, flashes a reassuring smile and says: "Something seems wrong over there, I think they need help—come with me!"

> Overcome: 2 Rapport + 1 = 3 (Good) _Succeeds with Style_ +1 boost _Love a Man Who Takes Charge_

Sam and the young woman need to cover more distance than Marcus to reach the tender and they arrive in time to give him a hand up off the ground.

"You alright there mate?""

While fighting to catch the breath that just got knocked out of him, Marcus croaks, "Ow," and uses the offered assistance to stand up. "Thanks for the help. We need to back away from the plane and let them do their job."

"Right," Sam agrees, "But what the hell were they waiting for? What were you doing up there?"

"Well they're all over it now; best we just stay out of their way. As to why the hesitation and what I was doing, there's a big difference between training and the real thing. Sometimes you hesitate more than you'd like to think you would, even with your training. It's all a mental problem and one I'm very familiar with," Marcus holds out his hand to Sam as he introduces himself, "Marcus Cain, paramedic with the New York City Fire Department. Thanks again for helping me back on my feet."

"No worries, it's the least I could do. I'm Sam, security consultant. And this is..."

"Oh, I'm Karly Dandleton."

"Nice to meet you Karly. So, FDNY paramedic, huh? Nice to have someone like you around, and I guess you're the expert here—anything we can do to help?"

"These guys have things well in hand at the moment. If you'll excuse me, I'm going to get back to the group," Marcus nods down the runway where the flight crew has been coralling passengers. "If you want to help, come with me and look over everyone for injuries. I have a feeling a lot of people are in shock and might not be aware of the injuries they've sustained...

> Create an Advantage: 1 Empathy + 0 = 1 (Average) _Fails_, no aspect revealed.

...you too, sir, you should really come join the group," and with that, Marcus jogs off.

Sam and Karly turn to see who Marcus was talking to: a well-dressed man wearing sunglasses. At night.

> Create an Advantage: 1 Empathy + 1 + 2 _I Know Too Much About The ETA Council_ = 4 (Great) _Succeeds_, -1 fate point, reveals Mr. Rayban's aspect _Assassin For The ETA Council_

Sam recognizes something oddly familiar about Mr. Rayban's demeanor, something about his steady gait and rigid posture reminds him of the crooks he's had the displeasure of working with far too often.

The man in the suit smiles as he covers a last few steps toward them. The sun has set and the combination of flashing emergency lights and purple twilight is making it hard for Sam to get a good look at his face.

"Miss, one of the other passengers was asking after you, said they had something you dropped."

Karly pats her pockets and says, "Oh, shit, my phone! See ya, Sam," and takes off.

Being experienced in deception himself, Sam recognizes the neatness with which this man had just removed Karly from the scene. Finally it strikes him with full clarity. Mr. Rayban is about to try to kill him.

----

Hal, seeing the old lady is all in one piece, turns to check on the girl he ushered out. She's walking away from them both, listing a bit, and still sobbing.

"Hey kiddo, you alright?" he calls after her, but she doesn't respond. Just as he's shifting he weight to jog after her, the old lady puts a hand on his arm.

"Be a dear and walk with me. We'll talk to her together," she says. Hal gives the her his arm. "Sweetheart, wait for us," she calls in a louder voice. The girl stops and and turns, wringing her hands. As they catch up with her, a couple jogs across their path toward the rear of the plane. Hal thinks they're heading for the fire-truck-thing that has just showed up, but his attention is focused here.

"I'm Hal, good to meet you," Hal says to his companion.

"Mauve, likewise," she says, patting his hand, but without taking her eyes of the girl. "You've been very brave, sweetheart. I can take care of you for now, don't you worry. We'll make some calls, have a lie down, and things will be fine before you know it."

The girl stands frozen for a moment with big eyes. Then she breaks into fresh wails and throws her arms around Mauve. The old lady waves off Hal.

"We'll be fine, dearie. You go on."

Hal feels like Mauve is handling the immediate sitation better than he could, so we winks at her and turns to survey the destruction.

"You two just help each other away from the plane, get to a safe distance."

"He's right, sweetheart, let's go," and the pair set off slowly.

Hal pulls his phone out of his pocket and a huge grin comes to his face when he discovers it's undamaged. He flips up twitter and starts to take a picture when the app recommends he try to get more of the burning plane in frame. "Good idea," he thinks, and jogs away a bit more.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AmericanAirlines?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AmericanAirlines</a> thanked me for flying today. <a href="https://t.co/GhxXaYHyqo">pic.twitter.com/GhxXaYHyqo</a></p>&mdash; Hal Bailmann (@HBailmann) <a href="https://twitter.com/HBailmann/status/916510126848094208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 7, 2017</a></blockquote>

He sees that they're trying to put out the fire now, but wonders where the EMTs are. As he looks around he sees flashing lights in the distance. It's an ambulance; it will be a minute before it arrives. But something about the people nearby catches his attention. Most are wandering away down the runway, or sitting down at a healthy distance, but one man in a suit is walking along the plane toward the crash tender.

> Create an Advantage: 2 Empathy + 1 = 3 (Good) _Ties_ +1 boost _He's Creeping Me Out_

Something is off about that guy, Hal thinks.

----

As some of Tabby's adrenaline starts to subside, making her a little shaky as she lets herself be herded by the flight crew with the other passengers, she starts to realize just how much the burns on her neck and arms hurt. Sure would be nice to get some ibuprophen, she thinks, and looks around the ragged mass of people for an EMT or at least someone that looks like they may know what they're doing.

No such luck at the moment. Really strange that there aren't all kinds of cars rushing out here, Tabby thinks, we _were_ just in a plane crash. She gets busy checking on people and generally being nice and supportive, which helps her relax.

"Excuse me," a man says as he walks up to her, extending his hand to shake. "I'm an EMT, I was on the plane. Marcus."

"Tabby. You're an EMT! Great, this is Lin," Tabby says, introducing the woman she's been talking to, "you should have a look at her—"

"Look, no offsense, and my apologies Lin, but I can see from here she's fine. I'd like your help with something else, Tabby."

"Uh, yeah, sure."

"I can tell you're good with people. I need you to go around and see everyone, calmly but quickly, and look for anything that really worries you. If you find anything, stay with them until I come back or they receive medical attention. It's important."

Tabby looks at Lin, who smiles and says she's fine. Tabby's a little miffed at being bossed around, but also really pleased to feel so useful and important. She also notices, through the gathering dark, that an ambulance is coming down the runway.

"We shouldn't wait for them, some people might need help right away. I'll go this direction," Marcus says, pointing a thumb back over his shoulder.

"Okay, Marcus," she says, cementing his name in her memory, "sure thing."
