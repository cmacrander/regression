## Actions and Outcomes

### Overcome

* When you fail an overcome action, you have two options. You can simply fail, which means you don’t attain your goal or get what you were after, or you can succeed at a serious cost.
* When you tie an overcome action, you attain your goal or get what you were after, but at a minor cost.
* When you succeed at an over- come action, you attain your goal without any cost.
* When you succeed with style at an overcome action, you get a boost in addition to attaining your goal.

### Create an Advantage

* When you fail, you either don’t create the aspect, or you create it but someone else gets the free invoke—whatever you end up doing works to someone else’s advantage instead.  at could be your opponent in a con ict, or any character who could tangibly bene t to your detri- ment. You may have to reword the aspect to show that the other char- acter bene ts instead—work it out with the recipient in whichever way makes the most sense.
* When you tie, you get a boost instead of the situation aspect you were going for.  is might mean you have to rename the aspect a bit to re ect its temporary nature (Rough Terrain becomes Rocks on the Path).
* When you succeed, you create a situation aspect with a free invocation.
* When you succeed with style, you get a situation aspect with two free
invocations instead of one.

### Attack

* When you fail at an attack, you don’t cause any harm to your target. (It also means that your target succeeded on the defend action, which could get you get saddled with other e ects.)
* When you tie an attack, you don’t cause any harm, but you gain a boost.
* When you succeed on an attack, you in ict a hit on your target equal to the number of shifts you got.  at forces the target to try and “buy o ” the value of your hit by taking stress or consequences; if that’s not possible, your target gets taken out of the con ict.
* When you succeed with style on an attack, it works like a normal success, but you also have the option to reduce the value of your hit by one to gain a boost as well.

### Defend

* When you fail at a defense, you su er the consequences of what- ever you were trying to prevent. You might take a hit or have an advantage created on you.
* When you tie a defense, you grant your opponent a boost.
* When you succeed at a defense, you successfully avoid the attack or the attempt to gain an advan- tage on you.
* When you succeed with style at a defense, it works like a normal success, but you also gain a boost as you turn the tables momentarily.

## Live Session

Plane crash was about 8:30. Hour later, FEMA is having some small initial response.

Systems become extremely brittle to attack by the non-blurred. Some state actor with a live hacker could launch a pre-packaged massive DDOS and take down the Internet. With so few people at hand to respond, systems go down.

Fine. What's the _most interesting_ way for them to go down? Like Stephenson said, "because I thought it would make a better story."

* Most forms of live broadcasting
  - news
  - talk shows
  - DJ'ed radio stations
* Cell
* Partial Internet <-- this is the next big regression

### Dr. Griffin and the Lab

They get to the lab. Any research they try to do on the place via cell starts to fail once they're in the area.

The door is unlocked (Dr. Griffin has a key) and there's no guard (he went home b/c he was worried about his family).

There's a working Internet connection in the building. They can do more research there. #blurry is trending on Twitter.

It's quiet. Lights are low. There are science-y presentation posters and signs for labs with complicated names. There's a directory mounted in the wall in the lobby.

There's a light on near the Neurotoxicoloy Lab. Dr. Griffin is in there, talking with someone (it's the Wizard, but that's secret). She's desparately trying to understand what's happening, she's panicked. (She's got tests running to see if her virus is in various samples. It is, in mutated form, but she doesn't know that yet, but she does suspect it.)

The players can interrogate her. She'll resist. She doesn't want to be the Horsewoman of the Apocalypse, so she won't to explain what she's doing. She doesn't want to go anywhere because she's got tests running.

Players will need to decide what to do about removing her from her work. If pressed with force, she'll divulge some information about how important the tests are. That she has good reason to think they're informative, actionable.

Ultimately the virus _can_ be mitigated. The Oracle created a pretty effective little monster, but it's not perfect, because it had to pass Dr. Griffin's initial inspection. If they let her stay and work for ~12 hours, she can apply a known but obscure/prototype anti-viral. Effects are random, but potentially reverse effects if applied quickly. Much too late to innoculate everyone, but enough to gain the support of critical Blurred NPCs.

Internet goes down at the Lab at the most dramatic potential moment.

### The Special Ops Team

The Players aren't the only tool in FEMA's kit, and FEMA isn't the only organization operating and looking for Dr. Griffin. Some obscure national defense military outfit has responded quite quickly. They're operating on the assumption that this is a coordinated attack by a terrorist organization for foreign power, likely biological. They've got just-unsealed orders to secure certain strains kept on ice at the lab and have a squad in the field.

```character
The Motley Crew

_The Enemy Could Be Anywhere_, _Off Balance_

Four AFSOC guys from 21st Special Tactics out of Pope Field NC https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_Special_Tactics_Squadron. An Airman (Don-Sun Ro), Airman First Class (Palgun "Sooty" Sood), Senior Airman (Gordon "Carp" Carpenter), and First Lieutenant (Rizalino "Riz" Mercado). The most junior member, Ro, is unblurred, and co-leading the squad, which results in some awkwardness.

Physical: ☐☐☐

Riz has an extra

```extra
Riot Rifle

Can fire rubber bullets, tazing darts, and mace rounds.

Cost: -1 to physique rolls (it's heavy)

- Overcome: Use Shoot and tazing darts to physically overcome a person.
- Create an Advantage: Use Shoot and the mace rounds to create a setting aspect that debilitates people in that zone for two rounds.
- Attack: Use Shoot and rubber bullets to cause physical stress and consequences, but not severe consquences or being taken out.
- Defend: Use Shoot and rubber bullets to employ supressing fire, assuming the enemy doesn't know the non-lethal nature of the rifle.
```

Their general approach is to neutralize anyone they come in contact with, by knocking them out with non-lethals, locking them in a room, hitting them in the head, etc. and moving on to secure their target.

If they encounter the party, especially if the party is cohesive, they'll try negotiation first, but they won't have much patience.

If they know that Mr. Rayban is about, with enough persuasion, they may hand over the Riot Rifle.

### Mr. Rayban

Mr. Rayban has two fate points (one refresh, one concession). He can't contact his handlers so he assumes his assignment is still to off Sam. He's also super pissed he didn't succeed before. Is _is_ blurred, but it's not slowing him down much.

If Mr. Rayban comes into contact with the Motley Crew, he may avoid them or kill them as the opportunities arise or as they complicate his mission.
