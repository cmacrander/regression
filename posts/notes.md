## Actions and Outcomes

### Overcome

* When you fail an overcome action, you have two options. You can simply fail, which means you don’t attain your goal or get what you were after, or you can succeed at a serious cost.
* When you tie an overcome action, you attain your goal or get what you were after, but at a minor cost.
* When you succeed at an over- come action, you attain your goal without any cost.
* When you succeed with style at an overcome action, you get a boost in addition to attaining your goal.

### Create an Advantage

* When you fail, you either don’t create the aspect, or you create it but someone else gets the free invoke—whatever you end up doing works to someone else’s advantage instead.  at could be your opponent in a con ict, or any character who could tangibly bene t to your detri- ment. You may have to reword the aspect to show that the other char- acter bene ts instead—work it out with the recipient in whichever way makes the most sense.
* When you tie, you get a boost instead of the situation aspect you were going for.  is might mean you have to rename the aspect a bit to re ect its temporary nature (Rough Terrain becomes Rocks on the Path).
* When you succeed, you create a situation aspect with a free invocation.
* When you succeed with style, you get a situation aspect with two free
invocations instead of one.

### Attack

* When you fail at an attack, you don’t cause any harm to your target. (It also means that your target succeeded on the defend action, which could get you get saddled with other e ects.)
* When you tie an attack, you don’t cause any harm, but you gain a boost.
* When you succeed on an attack, you in ict a hit on your target equal to the number of shifts you got.  at forces the target to try and “buy o ” the value of your hit by taking stress or consequences; if that’s not possible, your target gets taken out of the con ict.
* When you succeed with style on an attack, it works like a normal success, but you also have the option to reduce the value of your hit by one to gain a boost as well.

### Defend

* When you fail at a defense, you su er the consequences of what- ever you were trying to prevent. You might take a hit or have an advantage created on you.
* When you tie a defense, you grant your opponent a boost.
* When you succeed at a defense, you successfully avoid the attack or the attempt to gain an advan- tage on you.
* When you succeed with style at a defense, it works like a normal success, but you also gain a boost as you turn the tables momentarily.

## Live Session

Ok, I actually don't want to do this. But that's because

1. The players are being sticks in the mud. Partially my fault.
2. I hate everything lately, including this.

What do we need? _Conflict_.

Might as well bring out the big guns. There are two ideas. To the bio lab to figure out the Blur. Or to the Emerald City. Both while the world regresses.

Plane crash was about 8:30. Hour later, FEMA is having some small initial response.

Systems become extremely brittle to attack by the non-blurred. Some state actor with a live hacker could launch a pre-packaged massive DDOS and take down the Internet. With so few people at hand to respond, systems go down.

Fine. What's the _most interesting_ way for them to go down? Like Stephenson said, "because I thought it would make a better story."

* Most forms of live broadcasting
  - news
  - talk shows
  - DJ'ed radio stations
* Cell
* Partial Internet
* Power

What's in the car? Not much. Radio.

So, they get in. They drive out to I-40. Don't let them stew, because **players are lame** (gotta keep that snark under control). Call in with FEMA gal. She says,

"Our go-to for biological events is Dr. Kristine Griffin, at NIEHS, in the Research Triangle. Somebody taking notes? 111 T. W. Alexander Drive, Durham, Neurotoxicology lab. Will she be there? She better be. She's got instructions in case of an emergency. Acquire, extract, return. Out."

So they head off. Or maybe not. Let's assume they do. What gets in their way?

* Mr. Rayban with two fate points (one refresh, one concession)
* HellSons, spoling for a fight and some cop cars.
  - Not murderous, so coming in with fists and knives.
  - At least one is packing, if it gets that far.
  - Show up as soon as convenient. Probably at a gas station.

```character
HellSons

Semi-organized hoodlums. They've got police CBs, they've heard how weird shit is. Out to make trouble. They see the party aren't cops, see a chance to score some cop cars.

They get to the lab. Any research they try to do on the place via cell starts to fail once they're in the area.

The door is unlocked (Dr. Griffin has a key) and there's no guard (he went home b/c he was worried about his family).

There's a working Internet connection in the building. They can do more research there. #blurry is trending on Twitter.

It's quiet. Lights are low. There are science-y presentation posters and signs for labs with complicated names. There's a directory mounted in the wall in the lobby.

There's a light on near the Neurotoxicoloy Lab. Dr. Griffin is in there, talking with someone (it's the Wizard, but that's secret). She's desparately trying to understand what's happening, she's panicked. (She's got tests running to see if her virus is in various samples. It is, in mutated form, but she doesn't know that yet, but she does suspect it.)

The players can interrogate her. She'll resist. She doesn't want to be the Horsewoman of the Apocalypse. She doesn't want to go anywhere because she's got tests running.

Players will need to decide what to do about removing her from her work. If pressed with force, she'll divulge some information about how important the tests are. That she has good reason to think they're informative, actionable.

Ultimately the virus _can_ be mitigated. The Oracle created a pretty effective little monster, but it's not perfect, because it had to pass Dr. Griffin's initial inspection. If they let her stay and work for ~12 hours, she can apply a known but obscure/prototype anti-viral. Effects are random, but potentially reverse effects if applied quickly. Much too late to innoculate everyone, but enough to gain the support of critical Blurred NPCs.

Internet goes down at the Lab at the most dramatic potential moment.
