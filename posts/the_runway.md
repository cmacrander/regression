----

Marcus has just realized something is very wrong with first responders that have arrived. He's not sure there's anyone left on the plane, but is isn't sure there's not, either, so the fact that nothing is being done about the first is intolerable. The engine looks pretty different than the one's he's worked with, but he's suddenly confident he could be doing better than whoever is operating the thing.

Breathing raggedly, Marcus sprints over to it, praying he can make a better impression on them than he did on the stewardess. He hoarsely shouts that he's FDNY and can help.

> Overcome: 1 Rapport - 1 + 2 _You're Doing it Wrong_ + 2 _FDNY Paramedic_ = 4 (Great) _Ties_, -1 fate point

"What's wrong?" Marcus shouts into the cabin of the tender from the side step.

"There's something wrong with it, I think the pressure—"

The other fire fighter jumps in, "The pressure's fine, look, you haven't got it set so—"

"I knew the old one backwards and forwards..." with each exchange the fire fighters' pitch increases and their eyes get wider. The radio is crackling with chatter that Marcus can't make out.

"Let me in so I can see what's going on," Marcus interrupts.

"You can't just come in here and—"

"That fucking plane—which probably still has people on it—is fucking _on fire_ and you two are standing here holding your dicks! Fucking let me help!"

"Shit! Okay. See if you can do better, asshole. Mufid, call—"

Marcus slides up and looks around and instantly sees conspicuous indicator lights with clear labels that stand out from the bank controls.

> Overcome: 4 Lore - 2 = 2 (Fair) _Ties_

His background knowledge and exposure to fire engines combined with the fact that it's practically telling him what to do enable Marcus to deploy the arm and water. However, the arm is aiming somewhat perpendicular to the tender when high-pressure water is suddenly released, which is enough to tip Marcus back out of the cabin, landing him on his ass on the runway.

The fire fighters still inside seem to have caught on to what to do next and they quickly get the arm pointed in the right direction.

----

Sam sees the same curiously ineffective crash tender. He quickly looks at the people next to him in the crowd and singles out a tall young woman wearing a Nike t-shirt and some running shoes who looks calm despite the situation. Sam's mind goes back to his past in the corporate world where he used to be particularly good at schmoozing with higher up to get what he wants. He grabs her attention, flashes a reassuring smile and says: "Something seems wrong over there, I think they need help—come with me!"

> Overcome: 2 Rapport + 1 = 3 (Good) _Succeeds with Style_ +1 boost _Love a Man Who Takes Charge_

Sam and the young woman need to cover more distance than Marcus to reach the tender and they arrive in time to give him a hand up off the ground.

"You alright there mate?""

While fighting to catch the breath that just got knocked out of him, Marcus croaks, "Ow," and uses the offered assistance to stand up. "Thanks for the help. We need to back away from the plane and let them do their job."

"Right," Sam agrees, "But what the hell were they waiting for? What were you doing up there?"

"Well they're all over it now; best we just stay out of their way. As to why the hesitation and what I was doing, there's a big difference between training and the real thing. Sometimes you hesitate more than you'd like to think you would, even with your training. It's all a mental problem and one I'm very familiar with," Marcus holds out his hand to Sam as he introduces himself, "Marcus Cain, paramedic with the New York City Fire Department. Thanks again for helping me back on my feet."

"No worries, it's the least I could do. I'm Sam, security consultant. And this is..."

"Oh, I'm Karly Dandleton."

"Nice to meet you Karly. So, FDNY paramedic, huh? Nice to have someone like you around, and I guess you're the expert here—anything we can do to help?"

> GM compels Marcus' aspect _Something To Prove_: Marcus must take charge of the first aid that is surely needed by the main group of passengers. +1 fate point.

"These guys have things well in hand at the moment. If you'll excuse me, I'm going to get back to the group," Marcus nods down the runway where the flight crew has been coralling passengers. "If you want to help, come with me and look over everyone for injuries. I have a feeling a lot of people are in shock and might not be aware of the injuries they've sustained...

> Create an Advantage: 1 Empathy + 0 = 1 (Average) _Fails_, no aspect revealed.

...you too, sir, you should really come join the group," and with that, Marcus jogs off.

Sam and Karly turn to see who Marcus was talking to: a well-dressed man wearing sunglasses. At night.

> Create an Advantage: 1 Empathy + 1 + 2 _I Know Too Much About The ETA Council_ = 4 (Great) _Succeeds_, -1 fate point, reveals Mr. Rayban's aspect _Assassin For The ETA Council_

Sam recognizes something oddly familiar about Mr. Rayban's demeanor, something about his steady gait and rigid posture reminds him of the crooks he's had the displeasure of working with far too often.

The man in the suit smiles as he covers a last few steps toward them. The sun has set and the combination of flashing emergency lights and purple twilight is making it hard for Sam to get a good look at his face.

"Miss, one of the other passengers was asking after you, said they had something you dropped."

Karly pats her pockets and says, "Oh, shit, my phone! See ya, Sam," and takes off.

Being experienced in deception himself, Sam recognizes the neatness with which this man had just removed Karly from the scene. Finally it strikes him with full clarity. Mr. Rayban is about to try to kill him.

> Karly defends: 1 Empathy + 2 = 3 (Good) _Fails_

> Sam's roll is so good I'm going to call this contest, which would normally take place over three exchanges, in just one exchange.

"Karly, wait! Is this your phone?" Sam shouts. In a single fluid movement, he pulls the phone he picked up in the plane out of his pocket and dials a number.

Having only taken a couple steps, Karly turns back towards Sam. "I picked it up on my way down the slide, you must've dropped it." Sam says, as he tosses it to Karly, who catches it easily.

"It must be!" Karly says, without really looking at it.

As soon as Karly has the phone in her hands, Sam locks eyes with Mr. Rayban and says, speaking rapidly, "I know exactly who you work for and I'd stop right there if I were you."

Without breaking eye contact with Mr. Rayban, Sam continues, louder, "Karly, I need you to remain calm. If this man takes a single step towards me I want you to call the number I dialed into the phone."

"What the heck is going on Sam?"

"If you dial that number, the identities of the very bad people this man works for will be published for everyone to see." Sam pauses, dramatically. "We wouldn't want that now, would we?"

"Acceptable risk, Mr. Dunbar," and with that, Mr. Rayban hurls the bag he's carrying at Sam's head.

> Mr. Rayban Create an Advantage: 3 Fight + 1 = 4 (Great) _Succeeds with Style_, creates aspect on Sam _Knocked Down_ with two free invocations

> Sam Defend: 0 Fight + 1 = 1 (Average) _Fails_

Sam throws his hands up as the bag comes at his face. One of the straps tangles up his hand and the weight of it puts him off balance. He can't see what Mr. Rayban is doing while he's struggling just to remain standing, but he's sure it isn't good. He trips over his own feet and falls.

"I SAID NO GODDAMN LUGGAGE!"

> Mr. Rayban Defend: 3 Fight + 2 = 5 (Superb) _Ties_

Sam swipes the bag off his head in time to see the extremely pissed off and in-motion Steward try to wrap his arms around Mr. Rayban and take him off his feet. Mr. Rayban twists, gets an arm under the grapple and barely manages to shrug it off. Karly screams. Sam watches, paralyzed with surprise.

> Mr. Rayban Attack: 3 Fight - 1 = 2 (Fair) _Fails_

> Steward Defend: 2 Fight + 1 = 3 (Good) _Succeeds_

Mr. Rayban grabs the back of the Steward's shirt to pull him forward and aims a brutal knee at his face, but the Steward shakes his grip and sidesteps. Sam gets his feet set on the ground and starts to get up.

> Steward Attack: 2 Fight + 2 + 2 boost _Who IS This Guy?_ = 6 (Fantastic) _Succeeds_

> Mr. Rayban Defend: 3 Fight + 2 = 5 (Superb) _Fails_, takes 1 stress

> Sam's aspect _Knocked Down_ expires

The Steward leaps at Mr. Rayban and lands a nasty right hook on his jaw. Sam is standing—finally—and realizing he better do something.

He screams out and rushes into the fight, hoping to give the appearance of a threat and draw Mr. Rayban's attention away from the Steward.

> Sam Create an Advantage: 4 Deceive - 1 = 3 (Good) _Fails_

> Mr. Rayban Defend: 2 Empathy + 2 = 4 (Great) _Succeeds_

Unfortunately, Mr. Rayban has been in for too many fights to be had by such a simple tactic and he hits Sam with a effortless blow to the shoulder, sending Sam stumbling.

In the mean time, Karly, not exactly sure what the heck is going on, rushes to the crash tender and starts banging on the window and gesturing wildly.

Having brushed off Sam, Mr. Rayban turns his body back towards the Steward and, in one smooth motion, sends his left foot straight at the Steward's abdomen.

> Mr. Rayban Attack: 3 Fight + 0 = 3 (Good), _Fails_

> Steward Defend: 2 Fight + 3 = 5 (Superb), _Success with Style_, gains boost _This Little Piggy_

The Steward steps back from the kick and grabs Mr. Rayban's ankle, absorbing the blow with very little difficulty. He even looks Mr. Rayban in the eyes and grins a little.

> Steward Attack: 2 Fight - 3 + 2 _This Little Piggy_ = 1 (Average) _Ties_, gains boost _Throwing You Off Your Game_.

> Mr. Rayaban Defend: 3 Fight - 2 = 1 (Average) _Ties_

The Steward pivots in place with the ankle in his hands, aiming to rip Mr. Rayban off his footing, but his grip fails him and Mr. Rayban twists free. Flowing with the motion, he gets his released foot on the ground and aims another kick at the Steward with this other foot.

The kick never lands because Mr. Rayban, the Steward, and Sam are all suddenly forced to the ground by what feels to Sam like a combination of a sand blaster and a jackhammer.

```situation
The three combatants are _Soaking Wet_.

> Mr. Rayban _Concedes_, +1 fate point.

It only lasts a moment, but it's enough to thoroughly disorient Sam. When the world makes sense again, one of the firefighters is leaning over him, helping him up, while talking to the still-prone Steward.

"Why were you idiots fighting? Jesus, we have a burning plane to deal with. And you should know better!" he says, now helping the Steward up. "Get yourselves over to that ambulance out there, and away from the fire. Hey, were'd the other guy go?"

"He and Sam were defending themselves from that psycho!" Karly yells, pointing out past the crash tender, but her expression turns quizzical as she realizes she can't actually see him, which is confusing in the huge open space of the runyway.

"Ok guys, let's go," Same says, looking around suspiciously, "It'll be safer with a group." Sam looks at the Steward, "And thanks, uh&hellip;"

"Ramón. You're welcome. I have a problem with bullies."

"More like bullies have a problem with you."

Ramón smiles. "Usually, yeah. Here's your bag, for what it's worth." Ramón hands Sam a heavy, dripping-wet duffel. "And seriously, don't go for your stuff in an evacuation, its dangerous," he says, looking Sam hard in the eye, and hanging onto the duffel for a long second as Sam takes it.

"Right. Won't happen again. Scout's honor."

Ramón grunts. He and Sam and Karly walk together in exhausted silence toward the ambulance.

----

Hal, seeing the old lady is all in one piece, turns to check on the girl he ushered out. She's walking away from them both, listing a bit, and still sobbing.

"Hey kiddo, you alright?" he calls after her, but she doesn't respond. Just as he's shifting he weight to jog after her, the old lady puts a hand on his arm.

"Be a dear and walk with me. We'll talk to her together," she says. Hal gives the her his arm. "Sweetheart, wait for us," she calls in a louder voice. The girl stops and and turns, wringing her hands. As they catch up with her, a couple jogs across their path toward the rear of the plane. Hal thinks they're heading for the fire-truck-thing that has just showed up, but his attention is focused here.

"I'm Hal, good to meet you," Hal says to his companion.

"Mauve, likewise," she says, patting his hand, but without taking her eyes of the girl. "You've been very brave, sweetheart. I can take care of you for now, don't you worry. We'll make some calls, have a lie down, and things will be fine before you know it."

The girl stands frozen for a moment with big eyes. Then she breaks into fresh wails and throws her arms around Mauve. The old lady waves off Hal.

"We'll be fine, dearie. You go on."

Hal feels like Mauve is handling the immediate sitation better than he could, so we winks at her and turns to survey the destruction.

"You two just help each other away from the plane, get to a safe distance."

"He's right, sweetheart, let's go," and the pair set off slowly.

Hal pulls his phone out of his pocket and a huge grin comes to his face when he discovers it's undamaged. He flips up twitter and starts to take a picture when the app recommends he try to get more of the burning plane in frame. "Good idea," he thinks, and jogs away a bit more.

He sees that they're trying to put out the fire now, but wonders where the EMTs are. As he looks around he sees flashing lights in the distance. It's an ambulance; it will be a minute before it arrives. But something about the people nearby catches his attention. Most are wandering away down the runway, or sitting down at a healthy distance, but one man in a suit is walking along the plane toward the crash tender.

> Create an Advantage: 2 Empathy + 1 = 3 (Good) _Ties_ +1 boost _He's Creeping Me Out_

Something is off about that guy, Hal thinks. But he's more interested in getting off this dark, hot, smokey, uncomfortable runway. He starts walking toward the main group of passengers, the direction Mauve and the girl went, with the intention of getting to a hotel as directly as possible.

As he walks he dials his brother, who answers.

"Hey Hal, what's up man?"

"Hey Dylan. Calling to let you know I'm okay; my plane just crashed."

"Uh, what the fuck? You're... okay, you just said you're okay. What do you mean, crashed?"

"I'm looking at it," Hal says, turning to look over his shoulder, "and it's fucked up and on fire."

"Holy shit. Holy shit!"

"Yeah."

"So, you slid down the inflatable slide and all that shit?"

"Yup, all that shit."

"Whoa. But how can you be okay? You said it's on fire? Like, it blew up?"

"Kind of. It never really took off. It got going a bit but then tipped over and just one wing exploded, or something. We didn't, like, fall out of the sky."

"Holy shit man, I'm seriously glad you're okay. What the fuck? Planes don't just crash."

"I know, right."

"So you need anything? They're going to take you back... I dunno, you can't call a lyft and be like 'I&rsquo;m standing on a runway.' I'm being an idiot, I guess just do you need anything."

"No, man, thanks. They've got to send ambulances or one of those parking shuttles or something, then I'm going to get a hotel room and chill for awhile."

"Okay, okay, sure. Jesus."

"You okay?"

"Yeah, I mean, I haven't been in a plane crash lately, so yeah, I'm good."

"Seriously, Dylan. I'm fine anyway."

"Sure, I'm fine. Hea's been having a tough time today, which is making life a little hard. She's been real frustrated, then she got this big rash, which made her more frustrated. I've been trying to give her space. Everyone has a bad day sometimes. Like my brother who crashes planes."

"Hilarious. Okay, well, that's too bad, I hope it's nothing serious."

"Nah, allergies."

"Okay, well say hi to her for me. I'm going to call work and get some time off."

"Sounds good. Okay man, see ya. And take care of yourself. Don't drive yourself anywhere for awhile."

"Really, I'm fine. But yeah, see ya Dylan."

"Bye."

Hal is now amongst the other passengers, and scene looks straight out of a television show with the ambulance's headlights pouring over part of the crowd, and the blue and red lights strobing. It doesn't look like there is anything but the one ambulance and he doesn't expect the EMTs are about to shuttle him anywhere.

As Hal is wondering how dangerous it is to just start walking across possibly active runways in order to get back to the terminal when he overhears the two uniformed EMTs working through the crowd.

"Rash here too, mid torso, left side."

"I feel fine. What you mean 'here too', do I have something infectious?"

"If you're feeling fine then don't worry about it, sir."

```situation
**Runway With Passengers**

_Dark_, _Injured or Shocked People_
```

As some of Tabby's adrenaline starts to subside, making her a little shaky as she lets herself be herded by the flight crew with the other passengers, she starts to realize just how much the burns on her neck and arms hurt. Sure would be nice to get some ibuprophen, she thinks, and looks around the ragged mass of people for an EMT or at least someone that looks like they may know what they're doing.

No such luck at the moment. Really strange that there aren't all kinds of cars rushing out here, Tabby thinks, we _were_ just in a plane crash. She gets busy checking on people and generally being nice and supportive, which helps her relax.

"Excuse me," a man says as he walks up to her, extending his hand to shake. "I'm an EMT, I was on the plane. Marcus."

"Tabby. You're an EMT! Great, this is Lin," Tabby says, introducing the woman she's been talking to, "you should have a look at her—"

"Look, no offsense, and my apologies Lin, but I can see from here she's fine. I'd like your help with something else, Tabby."

"Uh, yeah, sure."

"I can tell you're good with people. I need you to go around and see everyone, calmly but quickly, and look for anything that really worries you. If you find anything, stay with them until I come back or they receive medical attention. It's important."

Tabby looks at Lin, who smiles and says she's fine. Tabby's a little miffed at being bossed around, but also really pleased to feel so useful and important. She also notices, through the gathering dark, that an ambulance is coming down the runway.

"We shouldn't wait for them, some people might need help right away. I'll go this direction," Marcus says, pointing a thumb back over his shoulder.

"Okay, Marcus," she says, cementing his name in her memory, "sure thing."

Tabby begins greeting passengers and asking after them. The first several she talks to are distant or dazed but responsive and not visibly harmed. Then she gets to a couple, a old woman and a young girl. The woman has found a piece of luggage to sit on and the girl is leaning against her.

"Hi you two, I'm Tabby. I'm checking in on everyone to make sure you're alright."

The woman makes eye contact and says, "Hi Tabby, I'm Mauve, and this is Celia. Would you take a look at this please?" Tabby steps closer. "Honey let me move your shirt just a little so we can make sure you're alright." Mauve lifts the hem of Celia's shirt a few inches and Tabby, who has the light on her phone handy, sees a bright red splotch on the girl's skin.

Without touching anything, Tabby asks, "Does that hurt, honey?" Celia shakes her head no. "You're sure? It doesn't itch or anything?"

"No," Celia says, quietly.

> Create an Advantage: 3 Empathy + 0 = 3 (Good) _Succeeds with Style_, reveals aspect _Not In Pain_ with two free invocations.

"She seems alright to me, Mauve, just shaken up. Would you like me to go get someone to take a second look?"

"No, no. Thank you. We'll just wait with everyone else."

Tabby nods and says her farewells and continues through the crowd. The ambulance arrives with two uniformed EMTs who start examining people—much more quickly than Tabby is, she realizes—at the periphery. She's come across a dozen people at this point with some kind of splotchy rash, some on their shoulders or neck, some on their forearms and tops of their hands. None of them are upset about it and some blame it on the smoke or the stress. But she works her way toward the EMTs with the intent to share this with them.

----

As Marcus attends to the many wandering shocked individuals from the plane crash he too has noticed the red blotches that Tabby did. He recognizes it's unusual and atypical of a fire-related injury. It must be something tangentially related to the plane crash. Growing increasingly concerned, Marcus investigates his own body closely.

> Create an Advantage: 0 Notice + 0 = 0 _Ties_, gains boost _I Seem Fine_

He doesn’t see anything out of the ordinary and breathes a sigh of relief.
Spotting the arrival of the paramedics, he rushes over to them and flashes his credentials before explaining

```

Marcus wastes no time negotiating pecking orders and launches into his primary concern. The EMTs recognize the command he has of the situation and look up from their patients to listen attentively.

"There's a more concerning issue than just this fire here. There are red rashes on people that are not burns and appear to have all shown up since after the crash from what I can discern. Make a call to the airport—we need to know if something special was being carried on this plane. In the meantime, all of these people, myself, yourselves, and the firefighters too, need to be quarantined until we identify the malignancy of this rash. I understand clearly that I cannot make this call, so get on your radio and explain what I'm telling you to the one who can."

> Overcome: 1 Rapport + 0 + 2 _I Know What I'm Talking About_ &#9745; &#9744; = 3 (Good) _Succeeds_

The EMTs both nod vigorously and then shake their heads and then nod some more. However several nearby passengers overhear Marcus and visibly react to the word "quarantine."

"Good call. I can radio back from the truck. But I also wanna know," Naoto lowers his voice as he realizes there's a frission in the crowd, and they are the epicenter, "who has this and who doesn't," Naoto whispers, looking to his partner, Carol.

"Yeah. I haven't found anyone who _hasn't_ had it yet. But no other signs of allergic reaction," Carol says.

"Well, I'm one," Marcus says.

"No rash?"

"None."

"Okay, I guess that's encouraging. Here," Carol pulls a memo pad and a pen from her extremely well-organized bag, "take names of anyone who's rash free, and let us know immediately if you see anything remotely like anaphylaxis. The rash could just be a lead-in." Naoto nods and briskly walks back toward the ambulance.

As Marcus turns to sort out which people he's going to work with next, Tabby comes up to him. She pinches his elbow, turns him away from the people closest to them, and whispers.

"Have you been seeing people with a painless rash?"

"Yeah. We," Marcus gestures toward Carol, who already has a blood pressure cuff on one passenger and is asking questions of another, "just talked about it. Everyone they've seen or I've seen has it. Except me."

"Okay, same here. Oh, and I don't have it either," Marcus' eyebrows go up a little and he nods, "but also," Tabby lowers her voice but sets her eyebrows in her "serious face" as she addresses Marcus. "Don't you think you should keep your voice down about the quarantine talk? These people are already traumatized and emotional. We don't need a hysterical mob on our hands, especially since there's still not enough help out here to care for them all."

Marcus frowns, clearly not enjoying the fact that Tabby has a point. He opens his mouth to rebut her but stops and shakes his head. "Look," he says, "I'm sure you're right, but the fact is we don't know what's happening here, except that it's no coincidence." He looks around the crowd and adds, "I wish we could announce to everyone that everything is fine, but it's not. There's nowhere for any of us to go, anyway; I think everyone's doing ok, considered."

Tabby also looks around and doesn't see any signs of panic. "Yeah, everything considered. Who haven't you talked to yet?"

Marcus points to another lobe of the crowd in the direction of the plane, and Tabby moves that way.

----

"So, Ramón, how does a flight attendant know how to fight so well?" Sam asks, before pulling the polo over his head.

"Growing up, my brother knew jiu-jitsu, I kind of picked it up along the way I guess."

"Who the hell was that man, Sam?" Karly asks.

"I'm not exactly sure who _he_ was, but I have a very good hunch I know who he was working for. Over the years I've made quite a few enemies on the wrong side of the law—that comes with the job description I suppose—but I've never been attacked before."

"What _is_ your job description?" Karly asked, looking like she was a little afraid of the answer.

"Oh, uh," Sam rubbed the back of his neck. "Security systems, I do security systems. Like set them up for museums, companies, stuff like that."

"Huh. So what was all that stuff you said about the calling the phone number?"

"Oh, that was nothing. I was just trying to distract him. Are you alright, Karly?"

"I'm a little unsettled by all this," she says, as she gestures to the scene around them, "but I'll be fine, all things considered."

"What about you, Ramón?" Sam asked.

"I've been worse. I wouldn't mind a dry change of clothes. Shouldn't there be a bus or something here by now?"

"Yeah," Karly adds, "let's go check the ambulance, maybe someone'll knows something. They might even have blankets to dry yourselves off."

The group walks over to the ambulance, leaving two trail of puddles behind them. When they are most of the way there, they notice a woman breaking away from the crowd and coming to meet them.

Tabby looks them over with a worried but warm smile as they approach, and immediately speaks up, "Hi, how is your skin??"

Ramon replies, "At the moment, wet mostly. You guys have any dry clothes in that ambulance?"

"Yeah, dry clothes would be great," Sam agrees.

"Wait a second," Karly says, "What was that about our skin?"

"I'm helping the EMTs check everyone out. The most common injury so far is burns or scrapes," Tabby explains.

Ramón, Sam, and Karly twist their arms this way and that and pat themselves a little. Sam and Karly report feeling fine, Ramón explains he picked up a scrape or two on his knuckles but is otherwise okay.

"I'd like to check more thoroughly, if you don't mind," Tabby says as she gestures with her phone's light, "sometimes with all the adrenaline you can miss things." She makes light of the situation by asking their names and making comments like, "can you believe all this" and "so glad you all made it out safely" while mixing in "just pull back your sleeve there" and "how's about back here".

"Ramón, you've got a nasty rash all down your back!" Karly exclaims.

"You've got something similar, Karly," Tabby points out. "I didn't see anything on Sam though." She steps back and puts her hands on her hips. "Okay. So you all want some dry clothes. Come on with me and we'll see what they've got in the ambulance."

The rest of the group shrug and nod and start walking.

```situation
Ambulance

One EMT, Naoto, in the cab.

_Radio On The Fritz_

"Hey, how's it going in there? We've got some people who need to dry off," Tabby says as she approaches.

"Hey, yeah, yeah. Blankets and towels in the back, right side, down low, blue drawer," Naoto replies, dividing his attention from what he's doing with some effort. Sam and Ramón hop into action.

"I've got some more info on who is and isn't affected," Tabby says, peering into the cab, "you need any help in there?"

"Trying to hail&hellip; well, anyone. We need shuttles, cops, cleanup... the whole ERP seems to be shit at the moment, just like this radio."

"ERP?"

"Emergency Response Plan. Ugh, screw this thing!"

A man Karly and Tabby hadn't noticed, standing bit outside the main floodlight, speaks up, "I might be able to help with the radio."

They all turn as Hal takes one step forward so he can be seen more clearly. He's tall and a little soft around the edges. "I've worked with them before."

"Look&hellip; oh, why the hell not. We need to get through somehow."

The man nods to Karly and Tabby as he gets in the cab and Naoto switches to the passenger seat, "Ladies."

"You just need to have this plugged in here instead of," and Hal moves the hand mic's plug into another jack, "and there ya go," he says, offering the mic to Naoto, who excitedly snaps it up.

"Dispatch, Dispatch, this is 2497, come in."

"2497 this is Dispatch, go ahead."

"We've got all of flight 4811 standing around here on the tarmac. Where are you guys, over."

"Roger, stand by on that. Any trouble with the equipment, over."

"Say again, Dispatch, over," Naoto scowls in confusion as he thumbs the mic.

"2497 have you had any trouble with your equipment, over."

"Affirmative, the radio was some trouble, yeah, over."

"Who fixed it, over."

"What the&hellip;" Naoto says, without keying the talk button. He looks at Hal, who shrugs. "A passenger, over."

"2497 require that you keep the passenger near the radio, over."

"Roger," Naoto pauses and shakes his head a tiny bit as if to wake himself up, "&hellip;wilco. And what about the other thing? Over."

"Stand by. This is wilco alpha charlie four oh, over and out."

"The fuck?" Naoto sits with the mic still poised near his face. He looks at Hal again, who shrugs again.

"Name's Hal," he said.

"Well, thanks for fixing the radio, Hal. You have any problem hanging out in the seat there?"

"No, sir."

"Right." Naoto puts the mic down and picks up his bag. "Uh, Hal, how are you doing? Any injuries?"

"Uh, maybe a bruise here or there. Not really."

"Any rash? On your arms or under your shirt?"

Hal looked at his arms, "I feel fine. You want me to lift my shirt?" Naoto nods. Hal leaned forward and pulls the back of his shirt up to his neck and twists left and right for Naoto to see.

"Ok, great, looks good."

Karly and Tabby, who have been leaning against the outside of the ambulance, chatting quietly, notice the radio go quiet. Karly stands up and looks into the cab. "What'd they say?" she asks.

"That we have to wait longer," Naoto says, as he walks around the front of the ambulance toward them.

Marcus and Carol part from the crowd, aiming for Naoto. "It's a short list," Carol says. "Marcus here. That's it."

"And Tabby Charmichael, who was helping me before you guys got here," Marcus adds, as Tabby walks up from behind the ambulance with Sam and Ramón in tow, with towels and messy hair.

"This guy, too," Naoto says, "Hal&hellip;"

"Harold Brimhall," Hal says, "but call me Hal."

"And Sam," Tabby says, quick on the inference.

"What are we talking about?" Sam asks.

Before anyone can answer, the radio crackles. "2497, 2497, this is wilco alpha charlie four oh, come in."

"Mind?" Hal says to Naoto and Carol.

"Uh—" Carol raises a hand to stop Hal, but Naoto cuts in.

"It's fine Carol. Dispatch wants to talk him, hell if I know why."

Hal reaches for the mic, standing half in and half out of the ambulance cab. "Dispatch this is 2497, helpful passenger speaking, go ahead," Hal says smoothly into the mic.

"This is FEMA R4 Deputy Regional Administrator Sariah Kendrick, thanks for getting on. Can you confirm the EMTs have been finding a rash on all the passengers?"

"Affirmative, I can put one of them on, over."

"No no, I want to talk to you. What's your name?"

"Hal Bailman, over."

"And can you also confirm you don't have it? The rash?"

"Affirmative, over."

"Okay. Okay." There was a lengthy pause, and Hal wasn't sure if he should speak. "We're sending a squad car for you. I need you to follow the officer's instructions when they get there."

"There are at least three others here who are unaffected, over."

When Hal says this it finally occurs to Naoto and Carol to check their own bodies. They quickly find the rash on themselves as well. They look at their skin, and then at each other, and both breathe out "fuuuuuuck" simultaneously.

"What was that? Repeat that. How many?"

Marcus holds up four fingers.

"Dispatch we have four unaffected people right here, and an unknown," Marcus makes a slicing gesture and shakes his head emphatically, "correction, we have a total of four. Everyone else has been checked out, over."

"Oh my god. Okay." Another pause. "We're sending two squad cars. The four people you mentioned are to get in those cars. Is that understood?"

Hal doesn't respond right away, but looks around those gathered. Sam manages to look a little green despite the flashing red lights. The rest just look very surprised.

"I'm sure we'd all like to know what's going on before we do that, over."

"The officers will explain when they get there. That's all, um," a quick silence, "Out. Over and out."
