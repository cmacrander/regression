After driving down increasingly dark and wooded roads, the party passes an illuminated plinth by a driveway clearly marking the entrance to the lab.

"Well," Marcus says, "I guess that's it." They pull in and follow signs for the main entrance. The trees don't hem the roadside, exactly, but ten yards further on two either side is a wall of green. There are widely-spaced street lights, but this far out from Raleigh the night is much darker than it was in the WalMart parking lot.

As they approach the lab, it's clear that there are a handful of lights on, scattered across the blocky buildings. Hal picks a parking spot near the closest building.

"Hey, alright!" Sam exclaims as Hal sets the brake.

"Your thing do the thing?"

"Yeah, except&hellip; Shit. Shit shit shit."

"What?" Marcus asks from the next parking space, leaning out his half-open door.

"Damn CloudML just locked my account!"

"You're going to have to unpack that a bit," Marcus says.

"I set up a fancy search with a service that does AI, but I must have set the wrong quota, or used the wrong credit card, or something, because they've locked me out."

Marcus looks at Hal. Hal shrugs.

"But it found something?" Marcus asks.

"Uh, right, yeah. Let's see&hellip; I'm going to have to read this a bit, but it's got some data here and some pages that are relevant."
