## WalMart

```situation
_It's a WalMart_, _Quiet_
```

Once they get through the main door, Sam says "Well, grab me large coffee and a big mac? I'll be there in a second." He turns down an aisle and vanishes into the larger Walmart.

Hal indulges in coffee and a chicken sandwich, gets Sam's order and an apple pie for later. Tammy orders two happy meals and also a coffee. She sweet-talks the kid behind the counter into giving her six creams. Marcus just orders a coffee.

Hal is the last to scoop up his orders and joins the reluctant gang. He sighs and asks them, "What d'you guys think about all this? Do we think we need to prepare for scarcity and—" Marcus and Tabby simultaneously frown and shush him. Hal turns red and lowers his voice. "—and infrastructure failure or just a road trip? Do we need water, fuel, days worth of food?"

Marcus and Tabby look down at their coffees and clearly don't want to talk just yet. Hal starts thumbing a shopping list into his phone: batteries of all kinds including two car batteries; an extra set of jumper cables; a fuel canister. He types reluctantly then erases "shotgun" and replaces with "crowbar." Speaker wire; sundry items from the hardware section; bottle(s) Johnny Walker Black; Little Debby oatmeal creek pies.

Sam finds the group at the table and sits down next to Hal. He's wearing some new clothes: dark jeans, a red long-sleeve t-shirt and a generic grey sweatshirt. He grabs the coffee that no one seems to have touched yet, "This one for me?" The others nod.

He pops off the lid and discreetly pulls a small bottle of Bailey's out of his sweatshirt pocket. "Anyone want some?" he asks as he pours some into his coffee, "I hear it works wonders for calming your nerves after a plane crash!" Sam isn't put out when no one grins or otherwise reacts to his sarcasm.

Sam leans over and looks at Hal's phone. "A crowbar? A fuel canister? What do you think we've gotten ourselves into? I thought we were just going to pick up this scientist lady and bring her to wherever Kendricks wants her to be."

"Wellll I mean I don't know that things are about to become all Mad Max or anything, but I don't know that they're not, either… anybody know where we can get our hands on some krugerrands?"

"What's a krugerrand?" Marcus asks.

"In seriousness, do you think we need to prepare for and be equipped to deal in, you know," Hal looks around, puts hand down on table out of view of other patrons and makes a finger gun, then finishes in hushed voice, "deadly force."

Sam replies, "Jesus, I hope not… One close encounter with death per night is more than enough for me. Anyway, we're basically just playing Uber at this point it seems. I mean, I'm all for being prepared but… This doesn't seem like that kind of crisis. Unless you think," Sam lowers his voice, "it was a terrorist attack or something?"

Before anyone can answer, someone announces through the PA system, "We apologize for the inconvenience, shoppers, but we will be closing in 15 minutes. Please bring your items to checkout. Thank you."

Tabby says, "Sam, I thought you said this was a 24-hour place."

"I did. It is. I mean, it's supposed to be?" Sam takes a bite out of his BigMac and pulls out his phone as he's chewing. "It says right here… open 24/7."

He takes another bite and starts checking Google, Twitter and other relevant online resources for anything related to the plane crash, the rash or that could explain the Walmart closing.

"Anyone have a theory as to what the heck is going on? Is closing down a Walmart a standard procedure in times of crisis? You learn about this stuff as an EMT Marcus?"

"Not many Walmart's in the boroughs, but it does feel like it might be related. Hal, you might not be wholly wrong in stocking up on some of that stuff. I don't know for sure anymore than anyone else does. Sam, people get scared when they don't know what they're ‘supposed' to be doing—and when they're scared, they have a tendency to get violent. I think we should be prepared for that. Tabby, from how you were standing up to Kay, I get the feeling that you and violence are somewhat acquainted. So, with that being said—we have 15 minutes. Everyone should grab what they think they might need."

Hal flashes his credit card and volunteers, "I've got about $7,200 unused balance on this one so let's max it out. I'll run through hardware and take requests. If somebody can grab some extra food and water for me and maybe a bottle of whiskey if you see it." Hal nervously eats his apple pie—which suddenly feels like a burden—in three big bites, barely taking time to taste it. He looks a little green when he's done.

Marcus heads off without making any requests, picking up classic emergency supplies: backpack, first aid, water, knife, flashlight, and dried food.

Taby and Hal confer, then grab carts and hurry through the store in opposite directions. Hal winds up in the sporting goods section first and a 34" softball bat rings loudly in his cart, then he loads up on anything that could fix a car or send a signal, texting with Marcus and Tabby as he goes.

Sam leisurely finishes eating his BigMac, picks up a few things in the electronics section and then grabs a party-sized bag of Chex Mix before heading to self-checkout. He heads outside and waits for the others as he sips his coffee, adding a little extra Bailey's.

Tabby is the second to the checkout with a cart full of bottled water, socks, blankets, and paperback novels. Only one aisle is staffed, by a man wearing a shirt and tie with no name tag instead of a WalMart vest. Tabby goes right up and makes conversation while unloading her cart.

"Hi," the man sighs, "welcome to WalMart."

```character
Store Manager

_Why Must I Do Everything Myself_
```

"Hey there! Why're you guys closing?" A puffy plastic package of women's ankle athletic socks hit the conveyor belt.

"Oh we're just having some trouble with staffing, scheduling all the shifts."

"That's too bad. Must be pretty bad if the store manager," Tabby glaces up and down the empty checkout lanes, "is the only one working checkout. You must have better things to do!" Tabby squats and wrangles a 48 pack of Ice Mountain out of the bottom of the cart.

"You can say that again. Yeah, it's pretty bad…" the man stops himself from saying more.

> Tabby Overcome: 1 Rapport + 0 roll = 1 (Average) _Ties_
> Manager Passive Opposition: 1

> The manager feels at ease enough to vent, but isn't friendly.

"At my coffee shop back in New York, it seems like I spend half my time just chasing after people who miss or move their shift."

"Mmm hmm," the Manager says, scanning a Hulk fleece throw. "Y'know, it's the strangest thing tonight, though. Not only did a bunch of my night shift not come in, but the ones who were here called me down to reset their points of sale maybe a dozen times, and then left early." The scanner beeps in a chunky Dan Brown.

"That's so strange!" Tabby agrees.

"I'm going to be writing emails all night explaining this to corporate, but I can't keep the store open if there's no one here!"

Hal and Marcus roll up with all their stuff. The Manager waves them forward as Tabby swipes her card. She relates his story to Hal and Marcus. When it comes time for Marcus to pay, the transaction won't go through.

"Try mine," Hal says, waving his card. Marcus shrugs and takes it. It doesn't work either.

"Okay," the Manager sighs, "might be the reader. Mind if I try it over here?"

"Go ahead," Hal says.

The Manager walks over to the next register and swipes a card from his pocket. He rapidly hits a series of buttons, then turns to the card reader and swipes Hal's credit card. "Huh," he says.

"Still nothing?" Tabby asks.

The Manager doesn't answer but goes to a third register and does the same thing. "That doesn't make any sense," he says, frowning, putting both hands on the counter and leaning in.

"Oh, shit," Hal says, suddenly groping for his phone.

"What?" asks Marcus, reacting to Hal's surprise and turning around.

Hal doesn't answer but just stares at his phone's total lack of cell signal. After a second he just holds up the phone for Marcus to see.

"What?!" Marcus steps toward Hal and reaches out for the phone.

"No bars."

"Ok, so we're in a dead zone, what do you—" Tabby says, interrupted by Sam awkwardly running in from the entry with heavy plastic shopping bags, almost dropping a huge, open bag of snack mix he had clearly been eating.

"Guys! I was on Twitter and suddenly lost my signal!"

The Manager looks up from the card reader he had been poking at. "I'm going to have to get some people in here to look at these. I'm sorry folks, but we'll have to close now."

Everyone looks at Marcus' and Hal's full carts, and then back at the Manager.

"Umm, hang on," Hal says, "we might have enough cash to cover this. Would mind waiting just a minute?"

The manager nods, and pulls out his own phone, frowning and tapping at it in frustration.

Marcus waves Sam over and the group confers.

"Did the manager say anything about why a 24/7 Walmart was closing?" Sam asks.


"Credit card billing appears to be not working, which could be related to the lack of bars on our cell phones. But besides that, no one showed up to cover their shifts. The issue at hand, whatever it is, appears to be expanding its impact. I wasn't confident that the airport was ground zero to begin with and now, even less so. Let's get all this stuff in the cars and get this scientist," turning to Sam, "do we have an address still and a map to get there or did we lose that when we lost cell coverage?"

"My satellite card is back in the car, but if the Internet is still there, it will work&hellip; oh shit, guys, the Internet is still there, right?" Sam grabs another handful of snack mix.

Hal ignores Sam's question but digs in his pockets for his wallet. A few seconds later he has a thick fold of bills that he splits with Marcus. Newly confident that he will be able to purchase his goods, he nervously tears into one of the oatmeal cream pies in his cart. He puts it down after one bite.

"Hey, uh, excuse me, sir," Hal asks the Manager, "is it just the credit card machines that aren't working? Do your, uh," he pauses to pull the term he recently heard from his memory, "points of sale need the Internet?"

> Hal Create an Advantage: 1 Rapport - 1 roll = 0 (Mediocre) _Fails_

> Manager Passive Opposition: 1

The manager slides his phone into his front shirt pocket. "I'm not an expert at these things, they're just supposed to work. I'd love to get you folks all taken care of, if you don't mind."

Hal nods, getting the message that the guy is tired and not ready to shoot the breeze. He looks around, trying to take in how other people might be reacting.

> Hal Create an Advantage: 3 Notice + 2 roll = 5 (Superb) _Succeeds with Style_ Situation passive opposion: 2, Hal creates aspect _Still With It_ &#9744; &#9744;

> Hal notices that the Store Manager is fluent and capable with his machines (despite their various malfunctions), unlike everyone else he's met since the plane crashed.

Hal and Marcus check out and pay with Hal's cash, while Tabby and Sam bag everything. Hal plucks a pen from his pocket and scribbles his name and number on the receipt.

"Guys," he says, looking around, "go with me for a second here, add your details to this receipt." He holds the paper and pen out to Marcus. Marcus squints a little, but does as Hal asks.

> Hal Overcome: 1 Rapport + 1 roll + 2 _Still With It_ &#9745; &#9744; = 4 (Great) _Succeeds_

> Manager passive opposition: 2

> The Manager is gratified someone has recognized his efforts and is willing to hear out Hal's unusual request.

"I know it's been a shit day," Hal says, and the Manager grunts in affirmation, "but we're, uhh, we're really grateful you were here to deal with it all and to help us out. If you need something&hellip;" Tabby finishes scribbling on the receipt and hands it back to Hal, who hands it to the Manager, "consider getting in touch. You might also reach us if you contact the airport."

The Manager passively accepts the receipt with an incredulous expression. "Ummmmm&hellip;"

"I know, I know, I sound crazy. Just, uh, just hang on to that, what can it hurt, right?"

"Okay, so," the Manager cracks a forced smile and puts the receipt in his pocket, "you folks have a good night!" He reaches over and turns off the checkout lane's light.

As the group walks out the door, Sam throws his empty McDonalds cup in the trash. "Um, Hal, what was that?"

"The guy wasn't confused, not with his register, not with phone. Everyone else he said couldn't work their checkout, but he was doing fine."

Marcus's eyebrows go up, "Ah! I'll bet he doesn't have a rash either."

"There were only four of us on that whole plane. I don't know how many people like him we're going to run into. I figured it would be good to at least try to, I don't know, make contact."

"Good thinking," Sam said, "But I'm more worried about Dr. Griffin. I don't know what these _instructions in case of an emergency_ were, but it doesn't seem like they included anyone answering at the lab, or the doctor's cell. I tried everything, no answer."

Tabby says, "Could be anything, like maybe she's just not picking up."

"Yeah, let's just get there," Hal says. "What channel are we on?"

"Same one," Marcus says, "Sam, why don't you ride with Hal and show him where to go. I'll follow with Tabby." Sam and Hal peel off to their car.

As they toss things into the trunk, Marcus asks Tabby, "If you don't mind, I'd like to know more about your intentions with that stick of yours and how familiar you are with using it."

"This?" Tabby looks down at her waistband where she had tucked the baton.

"Yes," as Marcus heaves in another three gallon water container, "that."

"No experience, really. I guess it just reminds me of one of the pieces of my kit. Sure feels better than nothing."

"Your kit?" Raises one eyebrow quizzically. "What?"

"Heh, yeah." Tabby tosses a backpack-sized first-aid-and-survival-kit. "I, uh, make things. My current favorite is tamper with a brass knuckle grip. This is a little like my sharpened portafilter; not quite as fun, obviously. Left it all back at my place though."

"You make things. Like, deadly weapons."

"Out of cafe paraphenalia, yup."

"And, um," Marcus stops loading for a second, "are you deadly with these deadly weapons?"

"Hah, what?" Tabby laughs, but sees that Marcus is serious. "I mean, no one's died yet! Lester, my training dummy, is mostly still in one piece."

"Mostly."

"Like you've never had a bad day."

"Touché."

Marcus and Tabby slam the truck closed, let the cart sit in the adjacent parking spot, get in the car, and pull out onto the road behind Sam and Hal.

In Sam and Hal's car, Sam asks, "Hal, before the cell signal gave out, I saw the 'blurry' hashtag was trending on Twitter&hellip; You ever heard of that before?"

Hal glances at other vehicle in the rearview. "&hellip;'blurry'?? Mmmnot ringing a bell. What context, what are people tweeting about? Like, eyesight?"

"I have no idea, all I saw was some girl tweeting that her&hellip;" Sam uses air-quotes "nerd boyfriend can't even rn." Sam puts his bag of Party Mix at his feet and pulls out his tablet to see if the satellite connection still works.

Sam grabs the radio and imitates the sound as it connects, "_Pshchrtt_ Sam here, good news folks: satellite internet still works! It's a lot slower than our normal 8g internet, but at least they don't throttle Netflix! We should be there in 10 minutes flat."

Sam grabs a handful of Party Mix and stuffs it in his mouth, before realizing something. He clicks the radio back on. "_munch munch_ Over _cough munch_."

As they drive towards the research lab, Sam heads back to Twitter and other news sources to try and figure what the hell is going on.

Hal glances over at Sam's travel rig. "That doesn't look like something you find at Frye's."

"Nope, definitely not available at retail! It's from&hellip; well, I guess you could call it 'military surplus'? But it's running a heavily customized OS and software package I put together."

"Customized for what?"

"Mostly me getting things done fast. For instance, I'm done poking idly at Twitter. I'm going to write an AI bot that runs a search for us, looking for interesting news stories. I'm also interested, since you pointed out there aren't many people like us without the rash, how much general Internet traffic has changed."

"You can do that?"

"Yup, just shut up for a minute so I can think."

> Sam Overcome: 3 Software + 0 roll = 3 (Good) _Ties_ passive opposition of 3

> Sam's AI bot is written and set to work in short order, and he configures it correctly to do the job he's interested in, but at a small cost.

"Ok, go go gadget search bot."

"Nice! So what's it say?"

"Dude, it's searching, like, the entire Internet."

"Oh. So you're saying it's not done yet."

"That's what I'm saying."

"Pass the snack mix."
