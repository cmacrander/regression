## Rash Decisions

> Stress clears

> Situation: _Dark_, _Five-Oh Inbound_

> NPCs: Ramón, Karly, Naoto, Carol, over a hundred nervous passengers

There's a short stunned silence in the group as the radio cuts off.

Tabby had been listening intently as Hal spoke to the FEMA person on the other end of the radio, listening for voice inflection, hesitation, or confusion. She notices she hadn't been using radio jargon like Hal had been. And the way she had paused and stuttered at times is giving Tabby the impression she was improvising, as if she has been forced to step up and take over even though it's not natural.

"As weird as this is, something even stranger is going on over there," Tabby says, gesturing at the radio. "That woman isn't used to this. Calling the shots, or whatever."

Marcus is still staring into the cab of the ambulance, as if waiting to hear something.

"Weird that there isn't more chatter on that frequency. Hal, maybe try the other channels to see what's what," he says.

Hal obliges and tunes the radio up and down the band listening for heightened voices or anything seemingly related to the crash or rash. There are other dispatchers and responders on other frequencies. There's lots of jargon mixed in and it's difficult to understand.

A thought occurs to Hal and he slowly takes his hands off the radio with his palms open and forward. Asking everyone and no one, he offers to the group gathered, "Do we have any idea or sense about how people are contracting this rash?" His manners fail him and his eyes stop on Naoto.

Naoto grunts, too distracted to be much insulted. "You've been touching and breathing the same stuff as everyone else. The radio is the least of your worries."

"Sorry, uh&hellip; yeah, sorry. Can you make anything out?"

Naoto frowns. "Some of those are calls asking for other districts to lend support with their units. Otherwise typical stuff."

Marcus turns to the others with visible impatience. "We should be able to find references to the crash as a breaking news story by now—some of us should check that on our phones. It would also help us discern if there is something larger afoot than just our plane crash. For instance, it strikes me as unusual and unlikely that a deputy regional administrator from FEMA is at emergency dispatch for the airport for a plane crash."

"Good idea," Sam says. "Karly, you mind checking social media? Surely someone has posted something, maybe American Airlines or RDU has responded. I'll check news sites and other communications."

Ramón shrugs and says he doesn't have his phone. "Because _I_ left my luggage on the plane," he adds, a little louder than necessary. Tabby and Karly get their phones out while Hal continues exploring the radio chatter.

Sam rummages through his bag and pulls out a small, rugged, almost military-looking tablet. He wipes off a few water drops with his shirt, the screen turns on and shows a lock screen for a couple seconds before springing to life.

Sam opens an app, hits "scan all frequencies" and a radar-like scanning icon is displayed momentarily before he swipes over to a news app, types in RDU and starts scrolling through the most recent news articles.

While the others are working, Marcus looks around the crowd to see if any of the passengers are using technology, expecting them to be calling loved ones or doing just what his companions are doing.

> Create an Advantage: 2 Notice + 0 = 2 (Fair) _Success_, discovers aspect _Darn Technology_ &#9744;

He notices that most people _aren't_ on their devices. The ones that are are mildly agitated, shaking their heads or commenting to those next to them, as if to say, "can you believe this thing?"

Ramón disappears behind the ambulance but quickly comes back. He's taken off his wet steward shirt and is wearing a reflective jacket with EMT logos on it. He walks over to the group while drying his hair in a towel.

Sam looks up from this laptop and gives him a quizzical look. "You’re a steward, a jiu-jitsu ninja _and_ an EMT?"

Ramon chuckles a little. "It’s the only shirt I found." Sam returns to his laptop, and Ramón catches Carol's eye. "Excuse me, I'm still worried, what do we know about this rash? Does it look like it’s stress induced? Allergies? Could it be from the heat and smoke? Does it look like anything you’ve seen before?"

"Sure," Carol says, sighing, "it could be any of that. People get rashes for all kinds of reasons and you usually never know why, they just go away. But all at once, on everyone? Beats me. I just make sure people are stable and call it in."

"Fair enough."

A half-panicked passenger comes over to Carol rattling off question after question, and she turns away from Ramón to intercept and calm them.

After a minute or 2 looking at news headlines, Sam switches to his scanning app, quickly glances over the results and doesn't notice anything out of the ordinary. He locks his tablet.

"The only mention of the crash is on CNN," Sam says, "but there is quite literally zero information other than 'a crash has been reported'. You find anything Karly?"

"Ugh, no. There's something wrong with my Twitter."

"A few people tweeted," Tabby adds, "other passengers I guess. One guy even took a pretty sweet photo."

"Hey, thanks," Hal says from the cab with a smile.

"Oh! Ha, yeah, that's you, Hal. Nice. But no, nothing from the airport or the airline." Tabby stops for a second and lets out a sharp laugh. "Ha. Get this&hellip; Our flight is marked as _'Delayed'_." She looks up at Sam with an incredulous look on her face. "And practically all other flights from here are either delayed or cancelled."

"Ok, that's weird, but it could be normal for an emergency," Sam points out.

"Right, but," Hal starts with a loud worried voice, which he quickly reduces to a whisper, "targeted extraction of four people from a hundred or so, last-chopper-out-of-Saigon-style, is definitely not."

"Without so much as a hot cocoa or a blanket," Marcus adds.

"Are you guys actually going to go with them?" Karly asks.

Nobody can think of how to answer Karly's question for a bit.

"Look out, everyone, coming through!" Mauve says clearly as she walks toward the ambulance from the crowd, still with her arm around the young girl. "Susan is going to have a sit-down right in there." Carol is out of sight, and Naoto shows no inclination to get in Mauve's way. "Lend me your jacket, young man," she says to Ramón, who promptly hands it over. "There, honey, it's getting a little cooler and you'll want this," she says as she wraps it around Susan.

"Now, I think we've been here long enough," Mauve says to Naoto. How she knows Naoto is the one to speak to and not Ramón isn't at all obvious. "No sense in waiting. I've talked to some very nice people here and most of them are fine to travel, I'm sure you'll agree. We can fit a dozen in this great buggy, all cozy. A couple of trips back and forth won't take a bit."

"Ma'am we need to be on hand in case someone's condition changes suddenly," Naoto says, shaking his head.

"I do understand, my dear. And I know your partner over there can handle it. But _my_ condition is elderly and tired and it's at risk of changing suddenly to serious pain your derriér," Mauve rubs Susan's shoulder as she says this to make it clear she's worried about more than herself.

"I've checked over most myself," Marcus says to Naoto, "and I've been watching; nobody's doing that badly. I think getting everyone out of here, even if it's not the fastest way, is a pretty good idea."

"Wonderful," Mauve says, as if its been decided, "Young man," she says to Ramón, "please go let everyone know they'll have a turn, and the good doctors will prioritize who gets on," and with that Mauve turns to fuss over Susan, clearly feeling her job has been done.

With Karly's question still hanging awkwardly over the conversation, Sam points into the distance where two sets of emergency lights emerge from the dark. "Look," he says.

Everyone turns to see. After staring and squinting a bit, it's clear there are three pairs of headlights.

"Hmph," says Ramón, not impressed. He turns on his heel and starts using his Steward-voice with the crowd. "Everyone who can hear me, please gather around! Gather in, people, that's it. We're going to get some of the worst-off folks into the ambulance and back to the terminal. Please assist anyone who is having trouble walking or standing&hellip;"

Hal looks between Tabby, Marcus, and Sam, trying to gauge their reactions. "Well," he says, "I'm not at all sure this is a good idea. I want to go home, not to a police station. I'm willing to hear what they have to say, but unless I'm under arrest&hellip;"

"That sounds right," agrees Sam.

"Look, guys, they're not coming out here specifically for us without some _very good_ reason. They don't even know our names," Marcus smirks at Hal, "not even 'Mr. Bailman' here. I'm guessing they need our help with something."

"But, like you said, they don't know us, why would they want us? To help with what?" Tabby asks.

"This might sound silly, but I was in New York on 9/11, and this feels a little like that. There was this time where no one was sure exactly what was going on, how bad it was. But we knew it was bad. I watched people put absolutely everything on hold and go&hellip;" Marcus trails off.

"Jesus!" Sam says, "You think something like 9/11 is going on out there?"

"Fucking _FEMA_," Hal says quietly.

"Here we go," Tabby says, nodding toward the vehicles pulling up. There are two squad cars and a shuttle bus with "Dollar" written on the side. One uniformed officer gets out of each car, and the bus driver stays put. The added headlight beams change the position of all the shadows and make it feel like they are suddenly in a different place.

The officers walk forward with that easy-but-careful stroll of police assessing a scene, coming straight toward the four while scanning all around. They stop at a conversational distance, one man beside and slightly behind the other. They don't say anything.

Tabby breaks first. "Good evening, officers."

They both nod, and the man in front says, "Evening. Glad to see so few people are hurt."

Ramón comes walking briskly up and says, "Is that shuttle for us? We've got a lot of people who want to get out of here."

"Go right ahead," the officer days, but he doesn't move.

"Great," Ramón says and goes to talk to the bus driver.

Sam clear his throat, but doesn't say anything.

"So you want to tell us what's going on?" Hal asks.

"You the four that dispatch mentioned?"

"That's us," Marcus says.

"Yeah, we can fill you in. Just step over here to the cars." Each of the four do their own idiosyncratic version of a deep breath and follow the cops over to the cars. The same officer starts speaking quietly, forcing them to form a tight circle so they can hear him.

"There isn't very much information. But it seems like the rash is very wide spread. Deputy Kendrick is working to gather everyone who is not affected for special assignments. You're to take these two units," the officer gestures at the cars, "and get on I-40. Deputy Kendrick will get in touch over the radio with next steps."
